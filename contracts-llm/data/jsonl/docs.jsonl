However, if no \nCovered Property has sustained di-\nrect physical loss or damage, the \nmost we will pay for removal of de-\nbris of other property (if such re-\nmoval is covered under this Addi-\ntional Coverage) is $5,000 at each \nlocation.\n(4) We will pay up to an additional $25,000 \nfor debris removal expense, for each lo-\ncation, in any one occurrence of physi-\ncal loss or damage to Covered Prop-\nerty, if one or both of the following \ncircumstances apply:\n(a) The total of the actual debris re-\nmoval expense plus the amount we \npay for direct physical loss or dam-\nage exceeds the Limit of Insurance \non the Covered Property that has \nsustained loss or damage.\n(b) The actual debris removal expense \nexceeds 25% of the sum of the de-\nductible plus the amount that we \npay for direct physical loss or dam-\nage to the Covered Property that \nhas sustained loss or damage.\nTherefore, if Paragraphs (4)(a) and/or \n(4)(b) apply, our total payment for direct \nphysical loss or damage and debris re-\nmoval expense may reach but will \nnever exceed the Limit of Insurance on \nthe Covered Property that has sus-\ntained loss or damage, plus $25,000.\n(5) Examples\nExample #1\nLimit of Insurance\n$\n90,000\nAmount of Deductible\n$\n500\nAmount of Loss\n$\n50,000\nAmount of Loss Payable\n$\n49,500\n($50,000 – $500)\nDebris Removal Expense\n$\n10,000\nDebris Removal Expense \nPayable\n$\n10,000\n($10,000 is 20% of $50,000)\nThe debris removal expense is less \nthan 25% of the sum of the loss payable \nplus the deductible. The sum of the loss \npayable and the debris removal ex-\npense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) \nis less than the Limit of Insurance. \nTherefore the full amount of debris re-\nmoval expense is payable in accor-\ndance with the terms of Paragraph (3).\nExample #2\nLimit of Insurance\n$\n90,000\nAmount of Deductible\n$\n500\nAmount of Loss\n$\n80,000\nAmount of Loss Payable\n$\n79,500\n($80,000 – $500)\nDebris Removal Expense\n$\n40,000\nDebris Removal Expense \nPayable\nBasic Amount\n$\n10,500\nAdditional Amount\n$\n25,000\nThe basic amount payable for debris re-\nmoval expense under the terms of Par-\nagraph (3) is calculated as follows: \n$80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = \n$20,000; capped at $10,500. The cap \napplies because the sum of the loss \npayable ($79,500) and the basic \namount payable for debris removal ex-\npense ($10,500) cannot exceed the \nLimit of Insurance ($90,000).\nThe additional amount payable for de-\nbris removal expense is provided in ac-\ncordance with the terms of Paragraph \n(4), because the debris removal ex-\npense ($40,000) exceeds 25% of the \nloss payable plus the deductible \n($40,000 is 50% of $80,000), and be-\ncause the sum of the loss payable and \ndebris removal expense ($79,500 + \n$40,000 = $119,500) would exceed the \nLimit of Insurance ($90,000). The addi-\ntional amount of covered debris re-\nmoval expense is $25,000, the maxi-\nmum payable under Paragraph (4). \nThus the total payable for debris re-\nmoval expense in this example is \n$35,500; $4,500 of the debris removal \nexpense is not covered.\n\nNIA-400 BOP 01 16\nIncludes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its per-\nmission.\nPage 5 of 39\nb.\nPreservation Of Property \nIf it is necessary to move Covered Property \nfrom the described premises to preserve it \nfrom loss or damage by a Covered Cause \nof Loss, we will pay for any direct physical \nloss of or damage to that property: \n(1) While it is being moved or while tempo-\nrarily stored at another location; and \n(2) Only if the loss or damage occurs within \n30 days after the property is first \nmoved. \nc.\nFire Department Service Charge \nWhen the fire department is called to save \nor protect Covered Property from a Cov-\nered Cause of Loss, we will pay up to \n$2,500 for service at each premises de-\nscribed in the Declarations, unless a differ-\nent limit is shown in the Declarations.

But we will not pay \nmore than the applicable Limit of Insurance of \nSection I – Property. \n2.\nBusiness Liability Coverage is excess over:\na.\nAny other insurance that insures for direct \nphysical loss or damage; or\nb.\nAny other primary insurance available to \nyou covering liability for damages arising \nout of the premises or operations for which \nyou have been added as an additional in-\nsured. \n3.\nWhen this insurance is excess, we will have no \nduty under Business Liability Coverage to de-\nfend any claim or \"suit\" that any other insurer \nhas a duty to defend. If no other insurer de-\nfends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be \nentitled to the insured's rights against all those \nother insurers. \nI.\nPremiums \n1.\nThe first Named Insured shown in the Declara-\ntions: \na.\nIs responsible for the payment of all premi-\nums; and \nb.\nWill be the payee for any return premiums \nwe pay. \n2.\nThe premium shown in the Declarations was \ncomputed based on rates in effect at the time \nthe policy was issued. On each renewal, con-\ntinuation or anniversary of the effective date of \nthis policy, we will compute the premium in ac-\ncordance with our rates and rules then in effect. \n3.\nWith our consent, you may continue this policy \nin force by paying a continuation premium for \neach successive one-year period. The premium \nmust be: \na.\nPaid to us prior to the anniversary date; and \nb.\nDetermined in accordance with Paragraph \n2. above. \nOur forms then in effect will apply. If you do not \npay the continuation premium, this policy will \nexpire on the first anniversary date that we have \nnot received the premium. \n4.\nUndeclared exposures or change in your busi-\nness operation, acquisition or use of locations \nmay occur during the policy period that are not \nshown in the Declarations. If so, we may require \nan additional premium. That premium will be de-\ntermined in accordance with our rates and rules \nthen in effect. \nJ.\nPremium Audit \n1.\nThis policy is subject to audit if a premium des-\nignated as an advance premium is shown in the \nDeclarations. We will compute the final pre-\nmium due when we determine your actual ex-\nposures. \n2.\nPremium shown in this policy as advance pre-\nmium is a deposit premium only. At the close of \neach audit period we will compute the earned \npremium for that period and send notice to the \nfirst Named Insured. The due date for audit pre-\nmiums is the date shown as the due date on the \nbill. If the sum of the advance and audit premi-\nums paid for the policy period is greater than the \nearned premium, we will return the excess to \nthe first Named Insured. \n3.\nThe first Named Insured must keep records of \nthe information we need for premium computa-\ntion, and send us copies at such times as we \nmay request. \nK.\nTransfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others \nTo Us \n1.\nApplicable to Businessowners Property Cover-\nage: \nIf any person or organization to or for whom we \nmake payment under this policy has rights to re-\ncover damages from another, those rights are \ntransferred to us to the extent of our payment. \nThat person or organization must do everything \nnecessary to secure our rights and must do \nnothing after loss to impair them. But you may \nwaive your rights against another party in writ-\ning: \na.\nPrior to a loss to your Covered Property. \nb.\nAfter a loss to your Covered Property only \nif, at time of loss, that party is one of the fol-\nlowing: \n(1) Someone insured by this insurance; \n(2) A business firm: \n(a) Owned or controlled by you; or \n(b) That owns or controls you; or \n(3) Your tenant. \n\nNIA-400 BOP 01 16\nIncludes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its per-\nmission.\nPage 39 of 39\nYou may also accept the usual bills of lading or \nshipping receipts limiting the liability of carriers. \nThis will not restrict your insurance.\n2.\nApplicable to Businessowners Liability Cover-\nage: \nIf the insured has rights to recover all or part of \nany payment we have made under this policy, \nthose rights are transferred to us. The insured \nmust do nothing after loss to impair them. At our \nrequest, the insured will bring \"suit\" or transfer \nthose rights to us and help us enforce them. \nThis condition does not apply to Medical Ex-\npenses Coverage. \nL.\nTransfer Of Your Rights And Duties Under This \nPolicy \nYour rights and duties under this policy may not be \ntransferred without our written consent except in the \ncase of death of an individual Named Insured. \nIf you die, your rights and duties will be transferred \nto your legal representative but only while acting \nwithin the scope of duties as your legal represen-\ntative.

PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.\nBUSINESSOWNERS ENHANCEMENT ENDORSEMENT\nThis endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:\nBUSINESSOWNERS COVERAGE FORM\nSection I - Property, Paragraph A. Coverage, 5. Additional Coverage, is revised as follows:\n1.\nThe most we will pay in Paragraph 5. c. Fire Department Service Charge is increased from $2,500 to \n$25,000. \n2.\nThe \"period of restoration\" in Paragraph 5. f. (1) Business Income (b) is increased from 12 consecutive \nmonths to 18 consecutive months and ordinary payroll is increased from 60 to 120 days. \n3.\nOrdinary payroll expenses in Paragraph 5. f. (1) Business Income (d) (i) is deleted and replaced by \nthe following: \n(i)\nMeans payroll expenses for all your employees except:\ni. \nEmployees under contract; and \nii. \nAdditional Exemptions shown in the Declarations as:\n\nJob Classifications; or\n\nEmployees.\n4.\nThe \"period of restoration\" in Paragraph 5. g. Extra Expense (4) is increased from 12 to 18 consecutive \nmonths.\n5.\nThe most we will pay for each location under Paragraph 5. h. Pollutant Clean Up and Removal is \nincreased from $10,000 to $25,000.\n6.\nThe Additional Coverage under Paragraph 5. l. Increased Cost Of Construction is replaced in its \nentirety by the following: \n5. I. \nA. Ordinance or Law Coverage \nIf a Covered Cause of Loss occurs to a building or buildings included as Covered Property as \ndescribed under Paragraph A.1.a of this Policy, the Ordinance or Law Coverage will pay, \nsubject to the terms, limits and conditions set forth within Section 5. I., the amounts set forth \nbelow. \nB. Application Of Ordinance or Law Coverage\nThe Ordinance or Law Coverage applies only if both B.1. and B.2. are satisfied and is then \nsubject to the qualifications set forth in B.3.\n1.\nThe ordinance or law:\na.\nRegulates the construction or repair of a building or buildings, or establishes \nzoning or land use requirements at the described premise; and \n\nNIA-402 BOP 05 20\nIncludes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its \npermission.\nPage 3 of 10\nb.\nIs in force at the time of loss.\nBut the Ordinance or Law Coverage under this endorsement applies only in response to the \nminimum requirements of the ordinance or law. Losses and costs incurred in complying with \nrecommended actions or standards that exceed actual requirements are not covered under \nSection 5. I.\n2.\nThe building or buildings sustain direct physical damage:\na.\nThat is covered under this policy and such damage results in enforcement of the \nordinance or law; or \nb.\nThat is covered under this policy and direct physical damage that is not covered \nunder this policy, and the damage to the building or buildings in its entirety results \nin enforcement of the ordinance or law.\nc.\nBut if the damage is not covered under this policy, and such damage is the subject \nof the ordinance or law, then there is no coverage under this Ordinance or Law \nCoverage even if the building or buildings has also sustained covered direct \nphysical damage.\n3.\nIf the situation described in B.2.b. above occurs, we will not pay the full amount of loss \notherwise payable under the terms of the Ordinance or Law Coverage. Instead, we will \npay a proportion of such loss; meaning the proportion that the covered direct physical \ndamage bears to the total direct physical damage.

The \nestimated total premium will be credited \nagainst the final premium due and the first \nNamed Insured will be billed for the \nbalance, if any. The due date for the final \npremium or retrospective premium is the \ndate shown as the due date on the bill.

Our share is the \nproportion that our limit of liability bears \nto the total of all applicable limits of \nliability for coverage on a primary basis.\n(2) On an excess basis, we will pay only our \nshare of the \"loss\" that must be paid \nunder insurance providing coverage on \nan excess basis.

The decision of the arbitrator will \nbe binding. \nF.

Other Insurance \nIf other valid and collectible insurance is available \nto the insured for a loss we cover under \nCoverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our \nobligations are limited as follows: \na. Primary Insurance \nThis insurance is primary except when \nParagraph b. below applies. If this insurance is \nprimary, our obligations are not affected unless \nany of the other insurance is also primary. \nThen, we will share with all that other \ninsurance \nby \nthe \nmethod \ndescribed \nin \nParagraph c. below. \nb. Excess Insurance \n(1) This insurance is excess over: \n(a) Any of the other insurance, whether \nprimary, excess, contingent or on any \nother basis: \n(i) That is Fire, Extended Coverage, \nBuilder's Risk, Installation Risk or \nsimilar coverage for \"your work\"; \n(ii) That is Fire insurance for premises \nrented \nto \nyou \nor \ntemporarily \noccupied by you with permission of \nthe owner; \n(iii) That is insurance purchased by you \nto cover your liability as a tenant for \n\"property \ndamage\" \nto \npremises \nrented \nto \nyou \nor \ntemporarily \noccupied by you with permission of \nthe owner; or\n(iv) If \nthe \nloss \narises \nout \nof \nthe \nmaintenance or use of aircraft, \n\"autos\" or watercraft to the extent not \nsubject to Exclusion g. of Section I – \nCoverage A – Bodily Injury And \nProperty Damage Liability. \n(b) Any other primary insurance available to \nyou \ncovering \nliability \nfor \ndamages \narising \nout \nof \nthe \npremises \nor \noperations, \nor \nthe \nproducts \nand \ncompleted operations, for which you \nhave been added as an additional \ninsured.\n(2) When this insurance is excess, we will have \nno duty under Coverages A or B to defend \nthe insured against any \"suit\" if any other \ninsurer has a duty to defend the insured \nagainst that \"suit\". If no other insurer \ndefends, we will undertake to do so, but we \nwill be entitled to the insured's rights \nagainst all those other insurers. \n(3) When this insurance is excess over other \ninsurance, we will pay only our share of the \namount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the \nsum of:\n(a) The total amount that all such other \ninsurance would pay for the loss in the \nabsence of this insurance; and \n(b) The total of all deductible and self-\ninsured amounts under all that other \ninsurance.\n(4) We will share the remaining loss, if any, \nwith any other insurance that is not \ndescribed \nin \nthis \nExcess \nInsurance \nprovision and was not bought specifically to \napply in excess of the Limits of Insurance \nshown in the Declarations of this Coverage \nPart. \nc. Method Of Sharing \nIf all of the other insurance permits contribution \nby equal shares, we will follow this method \nalso. Under this approach each insurer \ncontributes equal amounts until it has paid its \napplicable limit of insurance or none of the loss \nremains, whichever comes first. \nIf any of the other insurance does not permit \ncontribution by equal shares, we will contribute \nby limits. Under this method, each insurer's \nshare is based on the ratio of its applicable \nlimit of insurance to the total applicable limits of \ninsurance of all insurers. \n5. Premium Audit \na. We will compute all premiums for this \nCoverage Part in accordance with our rules \nand rates. \nb. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as \nadvance premium is a deposit premium only. \nAt the close of each audit period we will \ncompute the earned premium for that period \nand send notice to the first Named Insured. \nThe due date for audit and retrospective \npremiums is the date shown as the due date \non the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit \npremiums paid for the policy period is greater \nthan the earned premium, we will return the \nexcess to the first Named Insured. \nc. The first Named Insured must keep records of \nthe \ninformation \nwe \nneed \nfor \npremium \ncomputation, and send us copies at such times \nas we may request. \n6.

Those \nstatements \nare \nbased \nupon \nrepresentations you made to us; and \nc. We have issued this policy in reliance upon \nyour representations. \n7. Separation Of Insureds \nExcept with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and \nany rights or duties specifically assigned in this \nCoverage Part to the first Named Insured, this \ninsurance applies: \na. As if each Named Insured were the only \nNamed Insured; and \nb. Separately to each insured against whom claim \nis made or \"suit\" is brought. \n8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others \nTo Us \nIf the insured has rights to recover all or part of \nany payment we have made under this Coverage \nPart, those rights are transferred to us. The \ninsured must do nothing after loss to impair them. \nAt our request, the insured will bring \"suit\" or \ntransfer those rights to us and help us enforce \nthem. \n9. When We Do Not Renew \nIf we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we \nwill mail or deliver to the first Named Insured \nshown in the Declarations written notice of the \nnonrenewal not less than 30 days before the \nexpiration date. \nIf notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient \nproof of notice. \nSECTION V – DEFINITIONS \n1. \"Advertisement\" means a notice that is broadcast \nor published to the general public or specific \nmarket segments about your goods, products or \nservices for the purpose of attracting customers or \nsupporters.

Bankruptcy \nBankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the \ninsured's estate will not relieve us of our \nobligations under this Coverage Part. \n\nPage 4 of 6\n© Insurance Services Office, Inc., 2012 \nCG 00 33 04 13\n2. Duties In The Event Of Injury, Claim Or Suit \na. You must see to it that we are notified as soon \nas practicable of an \"injury\" which may result in \na claim. To the extent possible, notice should \ninclude: \n(1) How, when and where the \"injury\" took \nplace; \n(2) The names and addresses of any injured \npersons and witnesses; and \n(3) The nature and location of any \"injury\".\nb. If a claim is made or \"suit\" is brought against \nany insured, you must: \n(1) Immediately record the specifics of the \nclaim or \"suit\" and the date received; and \n(2) Notify us as soon as practicable. \nYou must see to it that we receive written \nnotice of the claim or \"suit\" as soon as \npracticable. \nc. You and any other involved insured must: \n(1) Immediately \nsend \nus \ncopies \nof \nany \ndemands, notices, summonses or legal \npapers received in connection with the \nclaim or \"suit\"; \n(2) Authorize us to obtain records and other \ninformation; \n(3) Cooperate with us in the investigation or \nsettlement of the claim or defense against \nthe \"suit\"; and \n(4) Assist us, upon our request, in the \nenforcement of any right against any \nperson or organization which may be liable \nto the insured because of \"injury\" to which \nthis insurance may also apply. \nd. No insured will, except at that insured's own \ncost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any \nobligation, or incur any expense, other than for \nfirst aid, without our consent. \n3. Legal Action Against Us \nNo person or organization has a right under this \nCoverage Part: \na. To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into \na \"suit\" asking for damages from an insured; or \nb. To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of \nits terms have been fully complied with. \nA person or organization may sue us to recover on \nan agreed settlement or on a final judgment \nagainst an insured; but we will not be liable for \ndamages that are not payable under the terms of \nthis Coverage Part or that are in excess of the \napplicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement \nmeans a settlement and release of liability signed \nby us, the insured and the claimant or the \nclaimant's legal representative. \n4. Other Insurance \nIf other valid and collectible insurance is available \nto the insured for a loss we cover under this \nCoverage Part, our obligations are limited as \nfollows: \na. Primary Insurance \nThis insurance is primary. Our obligations are \nnot affected unless any of the other insurance \nis also primary. Then, we will share with all that \nother insurance by the method described in b. \nbelow. \nb. Method Of Sharing \nIf all of the other insurance permits contribution \nby equal shares, we will follow this method \nalso. Under this approach each insurer \ncontributes equal amounts until it has paid its \napplicable limit of insurance or none of the loss \nremains, whichever comes first. \nIf any of the other insurance does not permit \ncontribution by equal shares, we will contribute \nby limits. Under this method, each insurer's \nshare is based on the ratio of its applicable \nlimit of insurance to the total applicable limits of \ninsurance of all insurers. \n5. Premium Audit \na. We will compute all premiums for this \nCoverage Part in accordance with our rules \nand rates. \nb. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as \nadvance premium is a deposit premium only. \nAt the close of each audit period we will \ncompute the earned premium for that period \nand send notice to the first Named Insured. \nThe due date for audit and retrospective \npremiums is the date shown as the due date \non the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit \npremiums paid for the policy period is greater \nthan the earned premium, we will return the \nexcess to the first Named Insured. \n\nCG 00 33 04 13\n© Insurance Services Office, Inc., 2012 \nPage 5 of 6\nc. The first Named Insured must keep records of \nthe \ninformation \nwe \nneed \nfor \npremium \ncomputation, and send us copies at such times \nas we may request. \n6. Representations \nBy accepting this policy, you agree: \na. The statements in the Declarations are \naccurate and complete; \nb. Those \nstatements \nare \nbased \nupon \nrepresentations you made to us; and \nc. We have issued this policy in reliance upon \nyour representations. \n7. Separation Of Insureds \nExcept with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and \nany rights or duties specifically assigned in this \nCoverage Part to the first Named Insured, this \ninsurance applies: \na. As if each Named Insured were the only \nNamed Insured; and \nb. Separately to each insured against whom claim \nis made or \"suit\" is brought. \n8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others \nTo Us \nIf the insured has rights to recover all or part of \nany payment we have made under this Coverage \nPart, those rights are transferred to us. The \ninsured must do nothing after loss to impair them. \nAt our request, the insured will bring \"suit\" or \ntransfer those rights to us and help us enforce \nthem. \n9. When We Do Not Renew \nIf we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we \nwill mail or deliver to the first Named Insured \nshown in the Declarations written notice of the \nnonrenewal not less than 30 days before the \nexpiration date. \nIf notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient \nproof of notice. \nSECTION V – DEFINITIONS \n1. \"Bodily injury\" means bodily injury, sickness or \ndisease sustained by a person, including death \nresulting from any of these at any time. \n2. \"Coverage territory\" means: \na.

Relevant considerations include whether markets served are \ndomestic or international, or whether services are targeted to local residents or to broad \nmarkets.  \n \nIt is important to know and understand any associations the MSB may have with other \njurisdictions (headquarters, operating facilities, branches, subsidiaries, etc.) and the individuals \nwho may influence its operations (political connections, etc.). A visit to the place of business \nmay be helpful to confirm the existence and activities of the entity. \n \nOwnership and control \nIn deciding who the beneficial owner is in relation to a customer who is not a private individual, \nthe objective must be to know who has ownership or control over the funds which form or \notherwise relate to the relationship, and/or form the controlling mind and/or management of any \nlegal entity involved in the funds. \n \n*Guide for how to interpret: ‘highest reasonable standard of diligence’ \n \nThe following questions should be used to guide the conversation with the agent when an aid \nagency is establishing whether he is an appropriate partner. \n \n(1) \nAgent selection: who is your agent at the pay-out destination?  How long have you been \ndealing with them?  Is this an established relationship (i.e. are you related to them or have \nyou conducted long-standing business with this person), or a new relationship? \n \n(2) \nPayment method: how do you settle payment with your agents?  By cash courier; trade; \nbank; third party settlement? \n \n(3) \nHuman resources: will you use your own resources, or will you outsource some of the \nassignment?  What is your capacity, and the acocuntability built into other relationships? \n \n(4) \nWorking capital: what is your average transaction size, and your largest?"}
