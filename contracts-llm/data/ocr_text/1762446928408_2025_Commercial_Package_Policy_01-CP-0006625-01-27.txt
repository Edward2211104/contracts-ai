IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RENEWAL POLICY
Thank you for renewing your policy with a company within the Nonprofits Insurance 
Alliance Group.
Because your policy met our eligibility criteria, your broker elected to have your policy 
automatically renewed. Please review this renewal policy carefully because it may 
contain terms and conditions that are different to or absent from your previous policy or 
policies.
Please confirm your policy is accurate. It is especially important to consider any 
changes since your last policy renewal. This could include buying or selling property, 
hiring employees for the first time, buying or selling vehicles, changes in location, and 
adding or changing programs or operations. If your agency has changed since your last 
renewal, please consider if those changes impact your insurance coverage.
If you have questions or need to make corrections to your policy, please contact your 
insurance broker.
We offer many coverages specifically designed for the nonprofit sector. If you feel you
may not be adequately covered or simply would like to learn more about our coverages,
please talk to your insurance broker or visit our website at 
www.insurancefornonprofits.org.
Thank you.

THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY.  PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
CONSTRUCTION – EXCLUSION
This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following: 
COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART
Except for a "construction" project that has been underwritten by us with all construction-related underwriting 
information received, and for which any additional premium required by us has been paid, and is specifically 
scheduled on the policy, this insurance does not apply to “bodily injury,” “property damage,” “personal and 
advertising injury,” or any claim for “damages” caused by, arising out of, or in any way related to the following:
1.
Any “construction” conducted by you or on your behalf that is “ongoing”; 
2.
Any “construction” conducted by you or on your behalf that is “completed”; 
3.
“Your work” on any building, structure, or real property for which a claim relating to 
“construction” has been presented; or, 
4.
“Your work” which may need correction, replacement, or repair. 
For specifically scheduled projects our coverage is excess to that of any other insurance available to an 
“insured” for “damages.”   
For purposes of this endorsement, “construction” will be deemed “ongoing” during the planning, preparation, 
construction, remodeling, or conversion phase.
For purposes of this endorsement, “construction” will be deemed “completed” at the earliest of the following 
times: 
1.
When all the work called for in the contract for “construction” has been “completed”; 
2.
When all the work to be done at a specific job site has been “completed” if the contract for 
“construction” calls for work at more than one job site; or,
3.
When that part of the work done at the job site has been put to its intended use by any 
person or organization other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the 
same project.
For the purpose of this endorsement, “construction” is defined as all “ongoing” or “completed” operations 
including, but not limited to, “your work” caused by, arising out of or in any way related to original 
construction, remodeling, development, demolition, roof repair or replacement, “mechanical system” 
repair or replacement, excavation, adaptation, conversion, and all other changes, structural and non-
structural, to any building, structure, or real property that you own, lease, occupy, or borrow. 
For the purpose of this endorsement, “mechanical systems” are defined as the building’s heating, 
ventilation air conditioning (HVAC), electrical and wiring, and plumbing systems including well and septic.  
For the purpose of this endorsement, “service and repair” shall mean making or keeping a structure, fixture, 
foundation, or equipment in proper condition and in its existing state, i.e., preventing its failure or decline. 
For purposes of this endorsement, “your work” is defined to mean work or operations, both “ongoing” and 
“completed”, performed by you or on your behalf and materials, parts or equipment furnished in 
connection with such work or operations. “Your work” is defined to include warranties or

(6) A determination by the Commissioner of 
Insurance that the: 
(a) Loss 
of,

our 
reinsurance covering all or part of

B. The

provision 
is

7. Residential Property 
This provision applies to coverage on real 
property which is used predominantly for 
residential purposes and consisting of not more 
than four dwelling units, and to coverage on 
tenants' household personal property in a 
residential unit, if such coverage is written 
under one of the following: 
Commercial Property Coverage Part 
Farm Coverage Part – Farm Property – Farm 
Dwellings, 
Appurtenant 
Structures 
And 
Household Personal Property Coverage Form
a. If such coverage has been in effect for 60 
days or less, and is not a renewal of 
coverage we previously issued, we may 
cancel this coverage for any reason, except 
as provided in b. and c. below. 
b. We may not cancel this policy solely 
because the first Named Insured has:
(1) Accepted 
an 
offer 
of 
earthquake 
coverage; or
(2) Cancelled or did not renew a policy 
issued by the California Earthquake 
Authority 
(CEA) 
that 
included 
an 
earthquake policy premium surcharge.
However, we shall cancel this policy if the 
first Named Insured has accepted a new or 
renewal policy issued by the CEA that 
includes an earthquake policy premium 
surcharge but fails to pay the earthquake 
policy premium surcharge authorized by the 
CEA.
c. We may not cancel such coverage solely 
because corrosive soil conditions exist on 
the premises. This restriction (c.) applies 
only if coverage is subject to one of the 
following, which exclude loss or damage 
caused by or resulting from corrosive soil 
conditions:

d. If a state of emergency under California 
Law is declared and the residential property 
is located in any ZIP Code within or 
adjacent 
to 
the 
fire 
perimeter, 
as 
determined by California Law, we may not 
cancel this policy for one year, beginning 
from the date the state of emergency is 
declared, solely because the dwelling or 
other structure is located in an area in 
which a wildfire has occurred. However, we 
may cancel:
(1) When you have not paid the premium, 
at any time by letting you know at least 
10 days before the date cancellation 
takes effect;
(2) If willful or grossly negligent acts or 
omissions by the Named Insured, or his 
or her representatives, are discovered 
that materially increase any of the risks 
insured against; or
(3) If there are physical changes in the 
property insured against, beyond the 
catastrophe-damaged condition of the 
structures and surface landscape, which 
result 
in 
the 
property 
becoming 
uninsurable.
C. The following is added and supersedes any 
provisions to the contrary: 
Nonrenewal
1. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs C.2. 
and C.3. below, if we elect not to renew this 
policy, we will mail or deliver written notice, 
stating the reason for nonrenewal, to the first 
Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and 
to the producer of record, at least 60 days, but 
not more than 120 days, before the expiration 
or anniversary date. 
We will mail or deliver our notice to the first 
Named Insured, and to the producer of record, 
at the mailing address shown in the policy. 
2. Residential Property 
This provision applies to coverage on real 
property used predominantly for residential 
purposes and consisting of not more than four 
dwelling units, and to coverage on tenants' 
household property contained in a residential 
unit, if such coverage is written under one of 
the following: 
Commercial Property Coverage Part 
Farm Coverage Part – Farm Property – Farm 
Dwellings, 
Appurtenant 
Structures 
And 
Household Personal Property Coverage Form
a. If 
this 
policy 
provides 
coverage 
as 
described in the preceding paragraph, and 
we elect not to renew this policy, we will 
mail or deliver written notice, stating the 
reason for nonrenewal, to the first Named 
Insured shown in the Declarations, and to 
the producer of record, at the mailing 
address shown in the policy, at least 75 
days, but not more than 120 days, before 
the expiration or anniversary date.
If we fail to give the first Named Insured 
shown in the Declarations notice of 
nonrenewal at least 75 days prior to the 
policy 
expiration, 
as 
required 
in 
the 
paragraph above, this policy, with no 
change in its terms and conditions, shall 
remain in effect for 75 days from the date 
that the notice of nonrenewal is delivered or 
mailed to the Named Insured. A notice to 
this effect shall be provided by us to the first 
Named 
Insured 
with 
the 
notice 
of 
nonrenewal.
b. We may elect not to renew such coverage 
for any reason, except as provided in 
Paragraphs c., d. and e. below.
c. We will not refuse to renew such coverage 
solely because the first Named Insured has 
accepted an offer of earthquake coverage. 
However, the following applies only to 
insurers who are associate participating 
insurers as established by Cal. Ins. Code 
Section 10089.16. We may elect not to 
renew such coverage after the first Named 
Insured 
has 
accepted 
an 
offer 
of 
earthquake coverage, if one or more of the 
following reasons applies: 
(1) The nonrenewal is based on sound 
underwriting principles that relate to the 
coverages provided by this policy and 
that are consistent with the approved 
rating plan and related documents filed 
with the Department of Insurance as 
required by existing law; 

Page 4 of 4
© Insurance Services Office, Inc., 2020 
IL 02 70 07 20
(2) The Commissioner of Insurance finds 
that the exposure to potential losses will 
threaten our solvency or place us in a 
hazardous 
condition. 
A 
hazardous 
condition includes, but is not limited to, a 
condition in which we make claims 
payments for losses resulting from an 
earthquake that occurred within the 
preceding two years and that required a 
reduction in policyholder surplus of at 
least 25% for payment of those claims; 
or 
(3) We have:
(a) Lost or experienced a substantial 
reduction in the availability or scope 
of reinsurance coverage; or
(b) Experienced a substantial increase 
in 
the 
premium 
charged 
for 
reinsurance 
coverage 
of 
our 
residential 
property 
insurance 
policies; and 
the Commissioner has approved a plan 
for the nonrenewals that is fair and 
equitable, and that is responsive to the 
changes in our reinsurance position.
d. We will not refuse to renew such coverage 
solely because the first Named Insured has 
cancelled or did not renew a policy, issued 
by the California Earthquake Authority, that 
included an earthquake policy premium 
surcharge.
e. We will not refuse to renew such coverage 
solely because corrosive soil conditions 
exist on the premises. This restriction (e.) 
applies only if coverage is subject to one of 
the following, which exclude loss or 
damage caused by or resulting from 
corrosive soil conditions:
(1) Commercial Property Coverage Part – 
Causes Of Loss – Special Form; or 
(2) Farm Coverage Part – Causes Of Loss 
Form – Farm Property, Paragraph D. 
Covered Causes Of Loss – Special.
f. If a state of emergency under California 
Law is declared and the residential property 
is located in any ZIP Code within or 
adjacent 
to 
the 
fire 
perimeter, 
as 
determined by California Law, we may not 
nonrenew 
this 
policy 
for 
one 
year, 
beginning from the date the state of 
emergency is declared, solely because the 
dwelling or other structure is located in an 
area in which a wildfire has occurred.
However, we may nonrenew:
(1) If willful or grossly negligent acts or 
omissions by the Named Insured, or his 
or her representatives, are discovered 
that materially increase any of the risks 
insured against; 
(2) If losses unrelated to the postdisaster 
loss condition of the property have 
occurred that would collectively render 
the risk ineligible for renewal; or
(3) If there are physical changes in the 
property insured against, beyond the 
catastrophe-damaged condition of the 
structures and surface landscape, which 
result 
in 
the 
property 
becoming 
uninsurable.
3. We are not required to send notice of 
nonrenewal in the following situations: 
a. If the transfer or renewal of a policy, without 
any changes in terms, conditions or rates, 
is between us and a member of our 
insurance group. 
b. If the policy has been extended for 90 days 
or less, provided that notice has been given 
in accordance with Paragraph C.1. 
c. If you have obtained replacement coverage, 
or if the first Named Insured has agreed, in 
writing, within 60 days of the termination of 
the policy, to obtain that coverage. 
d. If the policy is for a period of no more than 
60 days and you are notified at the time of 
issuance that it will not be renewed.
e. If the first Named Insured requests a 
change in the terms or conditions or risks 
covered by the policy within 60 days of the 
end of the policy period. 
f. If we have made a written offer to the first 
Named Insured, in accordance with the 
timeframes shown in Paragraph C.1., to 
renew the policy under changed terms or 
conditions or at an increased premium rate, 
when the increase exceeds 25%.

You should read this document carefully and contact us or your agent if you have any questions regarding Uninsured 
Motorists Coverage and your options with respect to this coverage.
This document includes general descriptions of coverage. However, no coverage is provided by this document. You 
should read your policy and review your Declarations Page(s) and/or Schedule(s) for complete information on the 
coverages you are provided.
A. Mandatory Offer Of Bodily Injury Uninsured Motorists Coverage
Please indicate your choices by initialing next to the appropriate item(s) below.
1. Selection Of Bodily Injury Uninsured Motorists Coverage

Bodily Injury Liability Coverage (split limits) or Combined Single Limit for Liability

2. Rejection Of Bodily Injury Uninsured Motorists Coverage
The California Insurance Code requires that we provide you with the following information:
"The California Insurance Code requires an insurer to provide uninsured motorists coverage in each 
bodily injury liability insurance policy it issues covering liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, 
or use of a motor vehicle. Those provisions also permit the insurer and the applicant to delete the 
coverage completely or to delete the coverage when a motor vehicle is operated by a natural person or 
persons designated by name. Uninsured motorists coverage insures the insured, his or her heirs, or legal 
representatives for all sums within the limits established by law, which the person or persons are legally 
entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury, including any resulting sickness, disease, or death, to 
the insured from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle not owned or operated by the 
insured or a resident of the same household. An uninsured motor vehicle includes an underinsured motor 
vehicle as defined in subdivision (p) of Section 11580.2 of the Insurance Code".

or use of a motor vehicle. Those provisions also permit the insurer and the applicant to agree to provide 
the coverage in an amount less than that required by subdivision (m) of Section 11580.2 of the Insurance 
Code but not less than the financial responsibility requirements. Uninsured motorists coverage insures 
the insured, his or her heirs, or legal representatives for all sums within the limits established by law, 
which the person or persons are legally entitled to recover as damages for bodily injury, including any 
resulting sickness, disease, or death, to the insured from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor 
vehicle not owned or operated by the insured or a resident of the same household. An uninsured motor

BUSINESSOWNERS COVERAGE FORM
SCHEDULE
The Exception Covering Certain Fire Losses (Paragraph B.2.) applies to property located in the following 
state(s):
California
Information required to complete this Schedule, if not shown above, will be shown in the Declarations.
A. The following definition is added with respect to 
the provisions of this endorsement:
"Certified act of terrorism" means an act that is 
certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
accordance with the provisions of the federal 
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, to be an act of 
terrorism pursuant to such Act. The criteria 
contained in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act for 
a "certified act of terrorism" include the following:
1. The act resulted in insured losses in excess of 
$5 million in the aggregate, attributable to all 
types of insurance subject to the Terrorism 
Risk Insurance Act; and 
2. The act is a violent act or an act that is 
dangerous 
to 
human 
life, 
property 
or 
infrastructure and is committed by an individual 
or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the 
civilian population of the United States or to 
influence the policy or affect the conduct of the 
United States Government by coercion.
B. Section I – Property is amended as follows:
1. The following exclusion is added:
a. Limited Exclusion Of Certified Acts Of 
Terrorism 
We will not pay for loss or damage caused 
directly or indirectly by a "certified act of 
terrorism". 
Such 
loss 
or 
damage 
is 
excluded regardless of any other cause or 
event that contributes concurrently or in any 
sequence to the loss. But this exclusion 
applies only when one or more of the 
following are attributed to such act:
(1) The terrorism is carried out by means of 
the 
dispersal 
or 
application 
of 
radioactive material, or through the use 
of a nuclear weapon or device that 
involves or produces a nuclear reaction, 
nuclear 
radiation 
or 
radioactive 
contamination; or

(2) Radioactive material is released, and it 
appears that one purpose of the

the 
dispersal 
or 
application 
of 
pathogenic or poisonous biological or 
chemical material; or
(4) Pathogenic or poisonous biological or 
chemical material is released, and it 
appears that one purpose of the 
terrorism was to release such material.
When this terrorism exclusion applies in 
accordance with the terms of Paragraph 
B.1.a.(1) 
or 
B.1.a.(2), 
the 
terrorism 
exclusion applies without regard to the 
Nuclear Hazard Exclusion in this Coverage 
Form.
2. Exception Covering Certain Fire Losses
The following exception to the Exclusion in 
Paragraph B.1. applies only if indicated and as 
indicated in the Schedule of this endorsement.
If a "certified act of terrorism" excluded under 
Paragraph B.1. results in fire, we will pay for 
the loss or damage caused by that fire, subject 
to all applicable policy provisions including the 
Limit of Insurance on the affected property. 
Such coverage for fire applies only to direct 
loss or damage by fire to Covered Property. 
Therefore, for example, the coverage does not 
apply to insurance provided under business 
income and/or extra expense coverage or 
endorsements that apply to those coverages.
C. Section II – Liability is amended as follows:
1. The following exclusion is added:
This insurance does not apply to:
TERRORISM
"Any injury or damage" arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of a "certified act of terrorism". 
However, this exclusion applies only when one 
or more of the following are attributed to such 
act:
a. The terrorism involves the use, release or 
escape of nuclear materials, or directly or 
indirectly results in nuclear reaction or 
radiation or radioactive contamination; or
b. The terrorism is carried out by means of the 
dispersal or application of pathogenic or 
poisonous biological or chemical materials; 
or
c. Pathogenic or poisonous biological or 
chemical materials are released, and it 
appears that one purpose of the terrorism 
was to release such materials.
2. The following definition is added:
a. For the purposes of this endorsement, "any 
injury or damage" means any injury or 
damage covered under this coverage form 
or 
any 
applicable 
endorsement, 
and 
includes but is not limited to "bodily injury", 
"property 
damage" 
or 
"personal 
and 
advertising injury" as may be defined in this 
coverage 
form 
or 
any 
applicable 
endorsement.
D. Section I – Property and Section II – Liability 
are amended as follows:
CAP ON CERTIFIED TERRORISM LOSSES
The following limitation applies to coverage for any 
one or more "certified acts of terrorism" that are 
not excluded by the terms of the exclusion in 
Paragraphs B.1. and C.1. and to any loss or 
damage that is covered and to which the 
exception in Paragraph B.2. applies.
If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist 
acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance 
Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year and we 
have met our insurer deductible under the 
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, we shall not be 
liable for the payment of any portion of the amount 
of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and in 
such case insured losses up to that amount are 
subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with 
procedures established by the Secretary of the 
Treasury.
E. The following provision is added to Section I – 
Property and Section II – Liability:
The terms and limitations of any terrorism 
exclusion, or the inapplicability or omission of a 
terrorism exclusion, do not serve to create 
coverage for loss or injury or damage that is 
otherwise excluded under this Policy.

"Any injury or damage" arising directly or indirectly,

include all insured damage sustained by 
property of all persons and entities affected by 
the terrorism and business interruption losses 
sustained by owners or occupants of the 
damaged property. For the purpose of this 
provision, insured damage means damage that 
is covered by any insurance plus damage that 
would be covered by any insurance but for the 
application of any terrorism exclusions; or
2. Fifty or more persons sustain death or serious 
physical injury. For the purposes of this 
provision, serious physical injury means:
a. Physical injury that involves a substantial 
risk of death; or

poisonous biological or chemical materials; or
5. Pathogenic or poisonous biological or chemical 
materials are released, and it appears that one 
purpose of the terrorism was to release such 
materials.
With respect to this exclusion, Paragraphs 1. and 2. 
describe the thresholds used to measure the 
magnitude of an incident of an "other act of 
terrorism" and the circumstances in which the 
threshold will apply for the purpose of determining 
whether this exclusion will apply to that incident.
B. The following definitions are added:
1. For the purposes of this endorsement, "any 
injury or damage" means any injury or damage 
covered under any Coverage Form to which this 
endorsement is applicable, and includes but is

States, on which United States 
income tax is paid and whose 
insurance coverage is subject to 
regulation in the United States), 
regardless of where the loss occurs; 
or
(b) The premises of any United States 
mission; and
c. The act is a violent act or an act that is 
dangerous to human life, property or 
infrastructure and is committed by an 
individual or individuals as part of an effort to 
coerce the civilian population of the United 
States or to influence the policy or affect the 
conduct of the United States Government by 
coercion.
3. "Other act of terrorism" means a violent act or 
an act that is dangerous to human life, property 
or infrastructure that is committed by an 
individual or individuals and that appears to be 
part of an effort to coerce a civilian population or 
to influence the policy or affect the conduct of 
any government by coercion, and the act is not 
a "certified act of terrorism". 
Multiple incidents of an "other act of terrorism" 
which occur within a seventy-two hour period 
and appear to be carried out in concert or to 
have a related purpose or common leadership 
shall be considered to be one incident.

CALIFORNIA CHANGES
This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:
BUSINESSOWNERS COVERAGE FORM
INFORMATION SECURITY PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT
A. Section I – Property is amended as follows:
1. With respect to an "open policy", the following is 
added to any provision which uses the term 
actual cash value:
a. In the event of a partial or total loss to a 
building or structure, actual cash value is 
calculated as a.(1) or a.(2), whichever is 
less:
(1) The amount it would cost to repair, 
rebuild or replace the property less a fair 
and reasonable deduction for physical 
depreciation of the components of the 
building or structure that are normally 
subject to repair or replacement during its 
useful life. Physical depreciation is based 
upon the condition of the property at the 
time of loss; or
(2) The Limit of Insurance applicable to the 
property.
b. In the event of a partial or total loss to 
Covered Property other than a building or 
structure, actual cash value is calculated as 
b.(1) or b.(2), whichever is less:
(1) The amount it would cost to repair or 
replace the property less a fair and 
reasonable 
deduction 
for 
physical 
depreciation, based on the condition of 
the property at the time of loss; or
(2) The Limit of Insurance applicable to the 
property.
c. An "open policy" is a policy under which the 
value of Covered Property is not fixed at 
policy inception, but is determined at the 
time of loss in accordance with policy 
provisions on valuation.
2. Paragraph E.2. Appraisal Property Loss 
Conditions is replaced by the following:
2. Appraisal
If we and you disagree on the value of the 
property or the actual cash value or the 
amount of loss, either may make written 
request for an appraisal of the loss. In this 
event, each party will select a competent 
and impartial appraiser. However, in the 
event of a government-declared disaster, as 
defined in the Government Code, appraisal 
may be requested by either you or us but 
shall not be compelled. Each party shall 
notify the other of the appraiser selected 
within 20 days of the request. The two 
appraisers will select an umpire. If they 
cannot agree within 15 days, either may 
request that selection be made by a judge of 
a court having jurisdiction. The appraisers 
will state separately the value of the property 
and actual cash value and amount of loss. If 
they fail to agree, they will submit their 
differences to the umpire. A decision agreed 
to by any two will set the amount of actual 
cash value and loss and will be binding. 
Each party will:
a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal 
and umpire equally.
If there is an appraisal, we will still retain our 
right to deny the claim.
3. Paragraph E.5.d.(1)(c) of the Loss Payment 
Property Loss Conditions is deleted.

4. Paragraphs E.5.d.(1)(d) and E.5.d.(5) of the 
Loss Payment Property Loss Conditions are 
replaced as follows:
(d) We will not pay on a replacement cost 
basis for any loss or damage until the 
lost or damaged property is actually 
repaired or replaced. Prior to such 
repair or replacement, we will pay the 
actual cash value of the lost or 
damaged property as described in 
Paragraph A.1. of this Endorsement. 
If the actual cash value does not 
exhaust the applicable Limit of 
Insurance, we will then pay the 
difference between the actual cash 
value and the replacement cost, 
provided 
that 
the 
repair 
or 
replacement is completed:
(i) Within 12 months after we pay the 
actual cash value; or
(ii) Within 36 months after we pay the 
actual cash value if the loss or 
damage relates to a state of 
emergency under California Law.
The following provision applies to real 
property which is used predominantly 
for 
residential 
purposes 
and 
consisting of not more than four 
dwelling units, and to coverage on 
tenants' household personal property 
in a residential unit: 
If you, acting in good faith and with 
reasonable diligence, encounter a 
delay or delays in approval for, or 
reconstruction of, the residence that 
are beyond your control, we shall 
provide one or more additional 
extensions of six months for good 
cause. Circumstances beyond your 
control include, but are not limited to:
(i) Unavoidable construction permit 
delays; 
(ii) The 
lack 
of 
necessary 
construction materials; or
(iii) The unavailability of contractors to 
perform the necessary work.
Nothing 
in 
this 
Paragraph 
(d) 
constitutes a waiver of our right to 
deny the claim for any valid reason or 
to restrict payment in cases of 
suspected fraud.
(5) Tenants' improvements and betterments 
at: 
(a) Replacement cost in accordance with 
the terms set forth in Paragraph (d) 
above.
(b) A proportion of your original cost if the 
property is not repaired or replaced. 
We will determine the proportionate 
value as follows: 
(i) Multiply the original cost by the 
number of days from the loss or 
damage to the expiration of the 
lease; and 
(ii) Divide the amount determined in 
(i) above by the number of days 
from 
the 
installation 
of 
improvements to the expiration of 
the lease. 
If your lease contains a renewal 
option, the expiration of the renewal 
option 
period 
will 
replace 
the 
expiration of the lease in this 
procedure. 
(c) Nothing if others pay for repairs or 
replacement.
B. Section III – Common Policy Conditions is 
amended as follows:
1. Paragraphs A.2. and A.3. Cancellation are 
replaced by the following:

3. All Policies In Effect For More Than 60 
Days 
a. If this Policy has been in effect for more

more of the following: 
(1) Nonpayment of premium, including 
payment due on a prior policy we 
issued and due during the current 
policy term covering the same risks.

of 
willful 
or 
grossly 
negligent acts or omissions, or of any 
violations of state laws or regulations 
establishing safety standards, by you 
or

which 
materially increase any of the risks 
insured against.
(5) Failure by you or your representative 
to implement reasonable loss control 
requirements, agreed to by you as a 
condition of policy issuance, or which 
were conditions precedent to our use 
of a particular rate or rating plan, if 
that failure materially increases any of 
the risks insured against.
(6) A determination by the Commissioner 
of Insurance that the:
(a) Loss of, or changes in, our 
reinsurance covering all or part of 
the 
risk 
would 
threaten 
our 
financial integrity or solvency; or
(b) Continuation 
of 
the 
policy 
coverage would:
(i) Place 
us 
in 
violation 
of 
California Law or the laws of 
the 
state 
where 
we 
are 
domiciled; or
(ii) Threaten our solvency.

change 
by 
you 
or 
your

changed risk, unless the added, 
increased or changed risk is included 
in the Policy.
b. We will mail or deliver advance written 
notice of cancellation, stating the reason 
for cancellation, to the first Named 
Insured, at the mailing address shown in 
the Policy, and to the producer of record,

2. The following provision is added to Paragraph 
A. Cancellation: 
7. Residential Property
This provision applies to coverage on real 
property which is used predominantly for 
residential purposes and consisting of not 
more than four dwelling units, and to 
coverage on tenants' household personal 
property in a residential unit. If such 
coverage has been in effect for 60 days or 
less and is not a renewal of coverage we 
previously issued, we may cancel this 
coverage for any reason, except that we 
may not cancel this Policy solely because:
a. Corrosive soil conditions exist on the 
premises; or
b. The first Named Insured has:
(1) Accepted an offer of earthquake 
coverage; or
(2) Cancelled or did not renew a policy 
issued by the California Earthquake 
Authority (CEA) that included an 
earthquake 
policy 
premium 
surcharge.

Page 4 of 6
© Insurance Services Office, Inc., 2020 
BP 01 55 07 20
However, we shall cancel this Policy if the 
first Named Insured has accepted a new 
or renewal policy issued by the CEA that 
includes an earthquake policy premium 
surcharge but fails to pay the earthquake 
policy premium surcharge authorized by 
the CEA.
If a state of emergency under California Law 
is declared and the residential property is 
located in any ZIP Code within or adjacent to 
the fire perimeter, as determined by 
California Law, we may not cancel this 
Policy for one year, beginning from the date 
the state of emergency is declared, solely 
because the dwelling or other structure is 
located in an area in which a wildfire has 
occurred. However, we may cancel:
a. When you have not paid the premium, at 
any time by letting you know at least 10 
days before the date cancellation takes 
effect;
b. If willful or grossly negligent acts or 
omissions by the named insured, or his 
or her representatives, are discovered 
that materially increase any of the risks 
insured against; or
c. If there are physical changes in the 
property insured against, beyond the 
catastrophe-damaged condition of the 
structures and surface landscape, which 
result 
in 
the 
property 
becoming 
uninsurable.
3. Paragraph 
C. 
Concealment, 
Misrepresentation Or Fraud is replaced by the 
following with respect to loss or damage caused 
by fire:
We do not provide coverage to the insured who, 
whether before or after a loss, has committed 
fraud 
or 
intentionally 
concealed 
or 
misrepresented 
any 
material 
fact 
or 
circumstance concerning:
a. This Policy;
b. The Covered Property;
c. That insured's interest in the Covered 
Property; or
d. A claim under this Policy.
4. Paragraph 
C. 
Concealment, 
Misrepresentation Or Fraud is replaced by the 
following with respect to loss or damage caused 
by a Covered Cause of Loss other than fire:
This Policy is void if any insured, whether before 
or after a loss, has committed fraud or 
intentionally concealed or misrepresented any 
material fact or circumstance concerning:
a. This Policy;
b. The Covered Property;
c. An insured's interest in the Covered 
Property; or
d. A claim under this Policy.
5. Paragraph H.1. Other Insurance is replaced by 
the following (with respect to coverage provided 
under Section I – Property):
If there is other insurance covering the same 
loss or damage, we will pay our share of the 
covered loss or damage. Our share is the 
proportion that the applicable Limit of Insurance 
bears to the Limits of Insurance of all insurance 
covering on the same basis.
We will not pay more than the applicable Limit 
of Insurance of Section I – Property.
6. The 
following 
paragraph 
is 
added 
and 
supersedes any provisions to the contrary: 
M. Nonrenewal 
1. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 
2. and 3. below, if we elect not to renew 
this Policy, we will mail or deliver written 
notice stating the reason for nonrenewal 
to the first Named Insured shown in the 
Declarations and to the producer of 
record, at least 60 days, but not more 
than 120 days, before the expiration or 
anniversary date. 
We will mail or deliver our notice to the 
first Named Insured, and to the producer 
of record, at the mailing address shown 
in the Policy. 
2. Residential Property 
This provision applies to coverage on 
real property used predominantly for 
residential purposes and consisting of 
not more than four dwelling units, and to 
coverage on tenants' household property 
contained in a residential unit.

BP 01 55 07 20

Page 5 of 6
If this Policy provides coverage as 
described in the preceding paragraph, 
and we elect not to renew this Policy, we 
will mail or deliver written notice, stating 
the reason for nonrenewal, to the first 
Named 
Insured 
shown 
in 
the 
Declarations, and to the producer of 
record, at the mailing address shown in 
the Policy, at least 75 days, but not more 
than 120 days, before the expiration or 
anniversary date.
If we fail to give the first Named Insured 
shown in the Declarations notice of 
nonrenewal at least 75 days prior to the 
policy expiration, as required in the 
paragraph above, this Policy, with no 
change in its terms and conditions, shall 
remain in effect for 75 days from the date 
that the notice of nonrenewal is delivered 
or mailed to the named insured. A notice 
to this effect shall be provided by us to 
the first Named Insured with the notice of 
nonrenewal.
We may elect not to renew such 
coverage for any reason, except that we 
will not refuse to renew such coverage 
solely because: 
a. The 
first 
Named 
Insured 
has 
accepted an offer of earthquake 
coverage. 
However, the following applies only to 
insurers 
who 
are 
associate 
participating insurers as established 
by Cal. Ins. Code Section 10089.16. 
We may elect not to renew such 
coverage after the first Named 
Insured has accepted an offer of 
earthquake coverage, if one or more 
of the following reasons applies: 
(1) The nonrenewal is based on 
sound underwriting principles that 
relate to the coverages provided 
by this Policy and that are 
consistent with the approved 
rating plan and related documents 
filed with the Department of 
Insurance as required by existing 
law; 
(2) The Commissioner of Insurance 
finds that the exposure to potential 
losses will threaten our solvency 
or place us in a hazardous 
condition. A hazardous condition 
includes, but is not limited to, a 
condition in which we make claims 
payments for losses resulting from 
an 
earthquake 
that 
occurred 
within the preceding two years 
and that required a reduction in 
policyholder surplus of at least 
25% for payment of those claims; 
or 
(3) We have:
(a) Lost 
or 
experienced 
a 
substantial reduction in the 
availability 
or 
scope 
of 
reinsurance coverage; or
(b) Experienced 
a 
substantial 
increase 
in 
the 
premium 
charged 
for 
reinsurance 
coverage of our residential 
property insurance policies; 
and 
the Commissioner has approved a 
plan for the nonrenewals that is 
fair and equitable, and that is 
responsive to the changes in our 
reinsurance position.
b. The 
first 
Named 
Insured 
has 
cancelled or did not renew a policy, 
issued by the California Earthquake 
Authority that included an earthquake 
policy premium surcharge.
c. Corrosive soil conditions exist on the 
premises.

BP 01 55 07 20
If a state of emergency under California 
Law is declared and the residential 
property is located in any ZIP Code within 
or adjacent to the fire perimeter, as 
determined by California Law, we may 
not nonrenew this Policy for one year, 
beginning from the date the state of 
emergency is declared, solely because 
the dwelling or other structure is located 
in an area in which a wildfire has 
occurred.
However, we may nonrenew:
a. If willful or grossly negligent acts or 
omissions by the named insured, or 
his 
or 
her 
representatives, 
are 
discovered that materially increase 
any of the risks insured against;
b. If losses unrelated to the postdisaster 
loss condition of the property have 
occurred 
that 
would 
collectively 
render the risk ineligible for renewal; 
or
c. If there are physical changes in the 
property insured against, beyond the 
catastrophe-damaged condition of 
the structures and surface landscape, 
which result in the property becoming 
uninsurable.
3. We are not required to send notice of 
nonrenewal in the following situations: 
a. If the transfer or renewal of a policy, 
without 
any 
changes 
in 
terms, 
conditions or rates, is between us and 
a member of our insurance group. 
b. If the Policy has been extended for 90 
days or less, provided that notice has 
been given in accordance with 
Paragraph 1. 
c. If you have obtained replacement 
coverage, or if the first Named 
Insured has agreed, in writing, within 
60 days of the termination of the 
Policy, to obtain that coverage. 
d. If the Policy is for a period of no more 
than 60 days and you are notified at 
the time of issuance that it will not be 
renewed. 
e. If the first Named Insured requests a 
change in the terms or conditions or 
risks covered by the Policy within 60 
days of the end of the policy period. 
f. If we have made a written offer to the 
first Named Insured, in accordance 
with 
the 
timeframes 
shown 
in 
Paragraph 1., to renew the Policy 
under changed terms or conditions or 
at an increased premium rate, when 
the increase exceeds 25%. 
C. The following changes apply only to Information 
Security Protection Endorsement BP 15 07 if it is 
attached to this Policy:
1. Paragraph (2) of Insuring Agreement d. 
Security Breach Liability is replaced by the 
following:
(2) We will pay for "defense expenses" as a 
result of a "claim" in the form of a 
"regulatory 
proceeding" 
first 
made 
against the insured during the "policy 
period" or during the applicable Extended 
Reporting Period, in response to a 
"wrongful act" or a series of "interrelated 
wrongful acts" covered under Paragraph 
d.(1).
2. Paragraph d. of the definition of "loss" in 
Paragraph V. is replaced by the following:
d. With respect to Insuring Agreements d. 
Security Breach Liability and g. Web Site

Compensatory 
damages, 
settlement 
amounts and costs awarded pursuant to 
judgments or settlements.

Additional Coverages 
a.
Debris Removal 
(1) Subject to Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), 
we will pay your expense to remove de-
bris of Covered Property and other de-
bris that is on the described premises, 
when such debris is caused by or re-
sulting from a Covered Cause of Loss 
that occurs during the policy period. 
The expenses will be paid only if they 
are reported to us in writing within 180 
days of the date of direct physical loss 
or damage.
(2) Debris Removal does not apply to costs 
to: 
(a) Remove debris of property of yours 
that is not insured under this policy, 
or property in your possession that 
is not Covered Property;
(b) Remove debris of property owned 
by or leased to the landlord of the 
building where your described 
premises are located, unless you 
have a contractual responsibility to 
insure such property and it is in-
sured under this policy; 
(c) Remove any property that is Prop-
erty Not Covered, including prop-
erty addressed under the Outdoor 
Property Coverage Extension;
(d) Remove property  of others of a 
type that would not be Covered 
Property under this policy; 
(e) Remove deposits of mud or earth 
from the grounds of the described 
premises; 
(f)
Extract "pollutants" from land or 
water; or 
(g) Remove, restore or replace pol-
luted land or water. 
(3) Subject to the exceptions in Paragraph 
(4), the following provisions apply:

(a) The most that we will pay for the to-
tal of direct physical loss or damage 
plus debris removal expense is the 
Limit of Insurance applicable to the 
Covered Property that has sus-
tained loss or damage.
(b) Subject to Paragraph (3)(a) above, 
the amount we will pay for debris 
removal expense is limited to 25% 
of the sum of the deductible plus 
the amount that we pay for direct 
physical loss or damage to the Cov-
ered Property that has sustained 
loss or damage. However, if no 
Covered Property has sustained di-
rect physical loss or damage, the 
most we will pay for removal of de-
bris of other property (if such re-
moval is covered under this Addi-
tional Coverage) is $5,000 at each 
location.
(4) We will pay up to an additional $25,000 
for debris removal expense, for each lo-
cation, in any one occurrence of physi-
cal loss or damage to Covered Prop-
erty, if one or both of the following 
circumstances apply:
(a) The total of the actual debris re-
moval expense plus the amount we 
pay for direct physical loss or dam-
age exceeds the Limit of Insurance 
on the Covered Property that has 
sustained loss or damage.
(b) The actual debris removal expense 
exceeds 25% of the sum of the de-
ductible plus the amount that we 
pay for direct physical loss or dam-
age to the Covered Property that 
has sustained loss or damage.
Therefore, if Paragraphs (4)(a) and/or 
(4)(b) apply, our total payment for direct 
physical loss or damage and debris re-
moval expense may reach but will 
never exceed the Limit of Insurance on 
the Covered Property that has sus-
tained loss or damage, plus $25,000.
(5) Examples
Example #1
Limit of Insurance
$
90,000
Amount of Deductible
$
500
Amount of Loss
$
50,000
Amount of Loss Payable
$

($50,000 – $500)
Debris Removal Expense
$
10,000
Debris Removal Expense 
Payable
$
10,000
($10,000 is 20% of $50,000)
The debris removal expense is less 
than 25% of the sum of the loss payable 
plus the deductible. The sum of the loss 
payable and the debris removal ex-
pense ($49,500 + $10,000 = $59,500) 
is less than the Limit of Insurance. 
Therefore the full amount of debris re-
moval expense is payable in accor-
dance with the terms of Paragraph (3).
Example #2
Limit of Insurance
$
90,000
Amount of Deductible
$
500
Amount of Loss

Amount of Loss Payable

Debris Removal Expense
$
40,000
Debris Removal Expense 
Payable
Basic Amount
$
10,500
Additional Amount
$
25,000
The basic amount payable for debris re-
moval expense under the terms of Par-
agraph (3) is calculated as follows: 
$80,000 ($79,500 + $500) x .25 = 
$20,000; capped at $10,500. The cap 
applies because the sum of the loss 
payable ($79,500) and the basic 
amount payable for debris removal ex-
pense ($10,500) cannot exceed the 
Limit of Insurance ($90,000).
The additional amount payable for de-
bris removal expense is provided in ac-
cordance with the terms of Paragraph 
(4), because the debris removal ex-
pense ($40,000) exceeds 25% of the 
loss payable plus the deductible 
($40,000 is 50% of $80,000), and be-
cause the sum of the loss payable and 
debris removal expense ($79,500 + 
$40,000 = $119,500) would exceed the 
Limit of Insurance ($90,000). The addi-
tional amount of covered debris re-
moval expense is $25,000, the maxi-
mum payable under Paragraph (4). 
Thus the total payable for debris re-
moval expense in this example is 
$35,500; $4,500 of the debris removal 
expense is not covered.

Coverage applies to your liability for fire de-
partment service charges:

through (2)(d), we will pay for loss or 
damage to that property only if such 
loss or damage is a direct result of the 
abrupt collapse of a building insured 
under this policy and the property is 
Covered Property under this policy. 
(5) If personal property abruptly falls down 
or caves in and such collapse is not the 
result of abrupt collapse of a building, 
we will pay for loss or damage to Cov-
ered Property caused by such collapse 
of personal property only if:
(a) The collapse of personal property 
was caused by a cause of loss 
listed in Paragraphs (2)(a) through 
(2)(d) of this Additional Coverage;
(b) The personal property which col-
lapses is inside a building; and
(c) The property which collapses is not 
of a kind listed in Paragraph (4), re-
gardless of whether that kind of 
property is considered to be per-
sonal property or real property.

damage to that personal property 
caused by the collapse.

does not apply to personal property that 
has not abruptly fallen down or caved 
in, even if the personal property shows 
evidence of cracking, bulging, sagging,

will not increase the Limits of Insurance

We will not pay the cost to repair any defect 
that caused the loss or damage; but we will

placed at the same premises, or if 
you elect to rebuild at another

the Increased Cost of Construction 
is the increased cost of construc-
tion at the same premises.

(c) If the ordinance or law requires 
relocation to another premises, the 
most we will pay for the Increased 
Cost of Construction is the in-
creased cost of construction at the 
new premises. 
(8) This Additional Coverage is not subject 
to the terms of the Ordinance Or Law 
Exclusion, to the extent that such exclu-
sion would conflict with the provisions 
of this Additional Coverage. 
(9) The costs addressed in the Loss Pay-

pendent property caused by or resulting 
from any Covered Cause of Loss.
However, this Additional Coverage 
does not apply when the only loss at the 
premises of a dependent property or 
secondary dependent property is loss 
or damage to "electronic data," includ-
ing destruction or corruption of "elec-
tronic data." If the dependent property 
or secondary dependent property  sus-
tains loss or damage to "electronic 
data" and other property, coverage un-
der this Additional Coverage will not 
continue once the other property is re-
paired, rebuilt or replaced.
The most we will pay under this Addi-
tional Coverage is $5,000 unless a 
higher Limit Of Insurance is indicated in 
the Declarations.
(2) We will reduce the amount of your Busi-
ness Income loss, other than Extra Ex-
pense, to the extent you can resume 
"operations," in whole or in part, by us-
ing any other available:
(a) Source of materials; or
(b) Outlet for your products.
(3) If you do not resume "operations," or do 
not resume "operations" as quickly as

sume "operations" as quickly as possi-
ble.
(4) Dependent property means property 
owned by others whom you depend on 
to:

supply services or power supply 
services;
(b) Accept your products or services;

an entity which is not owned or oper-
ated by a dependent property and 
which;
(a) Delivers materials and services to a 
dependent property, which in turn 
are used by the dependent prop-
erty in providing materials or ser-
vices to you; or
(b) Accepts materials or services from 
a dependent property, which in turn 
accepts your materials or services.  
 
A road, bridge, tunnel, waterway, 
airfield, pipeline or any other similar 
area or structure is not a secondary 
dependent property.
Any property which delivers any of 
the following services is not a sec-
ondary dependent property with re-
spect to such services:
(i)
Water supply services;

come under this Additional Coverage: 
(a) Begins 72 hours after the time of di-
rect physical loss or damage 
caused by or resulting from any 
Covered Cause of Loss at the 
premises of the dependent prop-
erty or secondary dependent prop-
erty; and
(b) Ends on the date when the property 
at the premises of the dependent 
property or secondary dependent 
property should be repaired, rebuilt 
or replaced with reasonable speed 
and similar quality.
(7) The Business Income coverage period, 
as stated in Paragraph (6), does not in-
clude any increased period required 
due to the enforcement of any ordi-
nance or law that:
(a) Regulates the construction, use or 
repair, or requires the tearing down 
of any property; or
(b) Requires any insured or others to 
test for, monitor, clean up, remove, 
contain, treat, detoxify or neutral-
ize, or in any way respond to, or as-
sess the effects of "pollutants."
The expiration date of this policy will not 
reduce the Business Income coverage

tained in the Business Income Addi-
tional Coverage also applies to this

by a Covered Cause of Loss. To the ex-
tent that "electronic data" is not re-
placed or restored, the loss will be val-
ued at the cost of replacement of the 
media on which the "electronic data" 
was stored, with blank media of sub-
stantially identical type.

(2) The Covered Causes of Loss applica-
ble to Business Personal Property in-
clude a computer virus, harmful code or 
similar instruction introduced into or en-
acted on a computer system (including 
"electronic data") or a network to which 
it is connected, designed to damage or 
destroy any part of the system or dis-
rupt its normal operation. But there is 
no coverage for loss or damage caused 
by or resulting from manipulation of a 
computer system (including "electronic 
data") by any employee, including a 
temporary or leased employee, or by an 
entity retained by you, or for you, to in-
spect, design, install, modify, maintain, 
repair or replace that system.
(3) The most we will pay under this Addi-
tional Coverage – Electronic Data for all 
loss or damage sustained in any one 
policy year, regardless of the number of 
occurrences of loss or damage or the 
number of premises, locations or com-
puter systems involved, is $10,000, un-
less a higher Limit of Insurance is 
shown in the Declarations. If loss pay-
ment on the first occurrence does not 
exhaust this amount, then the balance 
is available for subsequent loss or dam-
age sustained in, but not after, that pol-
icy year. With respect to an occurrence 
which begins in one policy year and 
continues or results in additional loss or 
damage in a subsequent policy year(s), 
all loss or damage is deemed to be sus-
tained in the policy year in which the oc-
currence began.
(4)  This Additional Coverage does not ap-
ply to your "stock" of prepackaged soft-
ware, or to "electronic data" which is in-
tegrated in and operates or controls a 
building's elevator, lighting, heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning or security 
system.
q.
Interruption Of Computer Operations
(1) Subject to all provisions of this Addi-
tional Coverage, you may extend the in-
surance that applies to Business In-
come and Extra Expense to apply to a 
suspension of "operations" caused by 
an interruption in computer operations 
due to destruction or corruption of 
"electronic data" due to a Covered 
Cause of Loss.
(2) With respect to the coverage provided 
under this Additional Coverage, the 
Covered Causes of Loss are subject to 
the following:
(a) Coverage under this Additional 
Coverage – Interruption Of Com-
puter Operations is limited to the 
"specified causes of loss" and Col-
lapse.
(b) If the Businessowners Coverage 
Form is endorsed to add a Covered 
Cause of Loss, the additional Cov-
ered Cause of Loss does not apply 
to the coverage provided under this 
Additional Coverage.
(c) The Covered Causes of Loss in-
clude a computer virus, harmful 
code or similar instruction intro-
duced into or enacted on a com-
puter system (including "electronic 
data") or a network to which it is 
connected, designed to damage or 
destroy any part of the system or 
disrupt its normal operation. But 
there is no coverage for an inter-
ruption related to manipulation of a 
computer system (including "elec-
tronic data") by any employee, in-
cluding a temporary or leased em-
ployee, or by an entity retained by 
you, or for you, to inspect, design, 
install, modify, maintain, repair or 
replace that system.

(3) The most we will pay under this Addi-
tional Coverage – Interruption Of Com-
puter Operations for all loss sustained 
and expense incurred in any one policy 
year, regardless of the number of in-
terruptions or the number of premises, 
locations or computer systems in-
volved, is $10,000 unless a higher Limit 
of Insurance is shown in the Declara-
tions. If loss payment relating to the first 
interruption does not exhaust this 
amount, then the balance is available 
for loss or expense sustained or in-
curred as a result of subsequent inter-
ruptions in that policy year. A balance 
remaining at the end of a policy year 
does not increase the amount of insur-
ance in the next policy year. With re-
spect to any interruption which begins 
in one policy year and continues or re-
sults in additional loss or expense in a 
subsequent policy year(s), all loss and 
expense is deemed to be sustained or 
incurred in the policy year in which the 
interruption began.
(4) This Additional Coverage – Interruption 
Of Computer Operations does not ap-
ply to loss sustained or expense in-
curred after the end of the "period of 
restoration," even if the amount of in-
surance stated in (3) above has not 
been exhausted.
(5) Coverage for Business Income does 
not apply when a suspension of "oper-
ations" is caused by destruction or cor-
ruption of "electronic data," or any loss 
or damage to "electronic data," except 
as provided under Paragraphs (1) 
through (4) of this Additional Coverage.
(6) Coverage for Extra Expense does not 
apply when action is taken to avoid or 
minimize a suspension of "operations" 
caused by destruction or corruption of 
"electronic data," or any loss or damage 
to "electronic data," except as provided 
under Paragraphs (1) through (4) of this 
Additional Coverage.
(7) This Additional Coverage does not apply 
when loss or damage to "electronic 
data" involves only "electronic data" 
which is integrated in and operates or 
controls a building's elevator, lighting, 
heating, ventilation, air conditioning or 
security system.
r.
Limited Coverage For "Fungi," Wet Rot 
Or Dry Rot 
(1) The coverage described in Paragraphs 
r.(2) and r.(6) only applies when the 
"fungi," wet rot or dry rot is the result of 
a "specified cause of loss" other than 
fire or lightning that occurs during the 
policy period and only if all reasonable 
means were used to save and preserve 
the property from further damage at the 
time of and after that occurrence. 
 
This Additional Coverage does not ap-
ply to lawns, trees, shrubs or plants 
which are part of a vegetated roof. 
(2) We will pay for loss or damage by 
"fungi," wet rot or dry rot. As used in this 
Limited Coverage, the term loss or 
damage means:
(a) Direct physical loss or damage to 
Covered 
Property 
caused 
by 
"fungi," wet rot or dry rot, including 
the cost of removal of the "fungi," 
wet rot or dry rot;
(b) The cost to tear out and replace 
any part of the building or other 
property as needed to gain access 
to the "fungi," wet rot or dry rot; and
(c) The cost of testing performed after 
removal, repair, replacement or 
restoration of the damaged prop-
erty is completed, provided there is 
a reason to believe that "fungi," wet 
rot or dry rot are present.
(3) The coverage described under this Lim-
ited Coverage is limited to $15,000. Re-
gardless of the number of claims, this 
limit is the most we will pay for the total 
of all loss or damage arising out of all 
occurrences of "specified causes of 
loss" (other than fire or lightning) which 
take place in a 12-month period (start-
ing with the beginning of the present 
annual policy period). With respect to a 
particular occurrence of loss which re-
sults in "fungi," wet rot or dry rot, we will 
not pay more than the total of $15,000 
even if the "fungi," wet rot or dry rot con-
tinues to be present or active, or recurs, 
in a later policy period.

(4) The coverage provided under this Lim-
ited Coverage does not increase the 
applicable Limit of Insurance on any 
Covered Property. If a particular occur-
rence results in loss or damage by 
"fungi," wet rot or dry rot, and other loss 
or damage, we will not pay more, for the 
total of all loss or damage, than the ap-
plicable Limit of Insurance on the af-
fected Covered Property.
If there is covered loss or damage to 
Covered Property, not caused by 
"fungi," wet rot or dry rot, loss payment 
will not be limited by the terms of this 
Limited Coverage, except to the extent 
that "fungi," wet rot or dry rot causes an 
increase in the loss. Any such increase 
in the loss will be subject to the terms of 
this Limited Coverage.
(5) The terms of this Limited Coverage do 
not increase or reduce the coverage 
provided under the Water Damage, 
Other Liquids, Powder Or Molten Mate-
rial Damage or Collapse Additional 
Coverages.
(6) The following applies only if Business 
Income and/or Extra Expense Cover-
age applies to the described premises 
and only if the suspension of "opera-
tions" satisfies all the terms and condi-
tions of the applicable Business Income 
and/or Extra Expense Additional Cov-
erage.
(a) If the loss which resulted in "fungi," 
wet rot or dry rot does not in itself 
necessitate 
a 
suspension 
of 
"operations," but such suspension 
is necessary due to loss or damage 
to property caused by "fungi," wet 
rot or dry rot, then our payment un-
der the Business Income and/or 
Extra Expense is limited to the 
amount of loss and/or expense 
sustained in a period of not more 
than 30 days. The days need not be 
consecutive.
(b) If a covered suspension of "opera-
tions" was caused by loss or dam-
age other than "fungi," wet rot or 
dry rot, but remediation of "fungi," 
wet rot or dry rot prolongs the "pe-
riod of restoration," we will pay for 
loss and/or expense sustained dur-
ing the delay (regardless of when 
such a delay occurs during the "pe-
riod of restoration"), but such cov-
erage is limited to 30 days. The 
days need not be consecutive.

Limit of Insurance for Buildings will auto-
matically increase by 8%, unless a different 
percentage of annual increase is shown in 
the Declarations. 
b.
The amount of increase is calculated as fol-

since the beginning of the current policy 
year, or the effective date of the most 
recent policy change amending the

Used for the same pur-
pose; or 
(iii) The amount that you actually 
spend that is necessary to re-
pair or replace the lost or dam-
aged property. 
If a building is rebuilt at a new 
premises, the cost is limited to the 
cost which would have been in-
curred had the building been built 
at the original premises.
(b) If, at the time of loss, the Limit of 
Insurance applicable to the lost or 
damaged property is less than 80% 
of the full replacement cost of the 
property immediately before the 
loss, we will pay the greater of the 
following amounts, but not more 
than the Limit of Insurance that ap-
plies to the property: 
(i)
The actual cash value of the 
lost or damaged property; or 
(ii) A proportion of the cost to re-
pair or replace the lost or dam-
aged property, after application 
of the deductible and without 
deduction 
for 
depreciation. 
This proportion will equal the 
ratio of the applicable Limit of 
Insurance to 80% of the full re-
placement cost of the property.  
Example
The full replacement cost of 
property which suffers a total 
loss is $100,000.  The property 
is insured for $70,000. 80% of 
the full replacement cost of the 
property immediately before 
the loss is $80,000 ($100,000) 
x .80 = $80,000).  A partial loss 
of $25,000 is sustained.  The 
amount of recovery is deter-
mined as follows: 
Amount of recovery
$70,000 ÷ $80,000 =.875
.875  x $25,000 = $21,875
(c) You may make a claim for loss or 
damage covered by this insurance 
on an actual cash value basis in-
stead of on a replacement cost ba-
sis. In the event you elect to have 
loss or damage settled on an actual 
cash value basis, you may still 
make a claim on a replacement 
cost basis if you notify us of your in-
tent to do so within 180 days after 
the loss or damage. 
(d) We will not pay on a replacement 
cost basis for any loss or damage: 
(i)
Until the lost or damaged prop-
erty is actually repaired or re-
placed; and 
(ii) Unless the repairs or replace-
ment are made as soon as rea-
sonably possible after the loss 
or damage.
However, if the cost to repair or re-
place the damaged building prop-
erty is $2,500 or less, we will settle 
the loss according to the provisions 
of Paragraphs d.(1)(a) and d.(1)(b) 
above whether or not the actual re-
pair or replacement is complete.
(e) The cost to repair, rebuild or re-
place does not include the in-
creased cost attributable to en-
forcement of or compliance with 
any ordinance or law regulating the 
construction, use or repair of any 
property. 
(2) If the Actual Cash Value – Buildings op-
tion applies, as shown in the Declara-
tions, Paragraph (1) above does not ap-
ply to Buildings. Instead, we will deter-
mine the value of Buildings at actual 
cash value. 
(3) The following property at actual cash 
value: 
(a) Used or secondhand merchandise 
held in storage or for sale;

(b) Property of others. However, if an 
item(s) of personal property of oth-
ers is subject to a written contract 
which governs your liability for loss 
or damage to that item(s), then val-
uation of that item(s) will be based 
on the amount for which you are li-
able under such contract, but not to 
exceed the lesser of the replace-
ment cost of the property or the ap-
plicable Limit of Insurance; 
(c) Household contents, except per-
sonal property in apartments or 
rooms furnished by you as land-
lord; 
(d) Manuscripts; and
(e) Works of art, antiques or rare arti-
cles, including etchings, pictures, 
statuary, marble, bronzes, porce-
lain and bric-a-brac. 
(4) Glass at the cost of replacement with 
safety glazing material if required by 
law. 
(5) Tenants' Improvements and Better-
ments at: 
(a) Replacement cost if you make re-
pairs promptly. 
(b) A proportion of your original cost if 
you do not make repairs promptly. 
We will determine the proportionate 
value as follows: 
(i)
Multiply the original cost by the 
number of days from the loss or 
damage to the expiration of the 
lease; and 
(ii) Divide the amount determined 
in (i) above by the number of 
days from the installation of im-
provements to the expiration of 
the lease. 
If your lease contains a renewal op-
tion, the expiration of the renewal 
option period will replace the 
expiration of the lease in this proce-
dure. 
(c) Nothing if others pay for repairs or 
replacement. 
(6) Applicable only to the Optional Cover-
ages: 
(a) "Money" at its face value; and 
(b) "Securities" at their value at the 
close of business on the day the 
loss is discovered. 
 (7) Applicable only to Accounts Receiv-
able: 
(a) If you cannot accurately establish 
the amount of accounts receivable 
outstanding as of the time of loss or 
damage: 
(i)
We will determine the total of 
the average monthly amounts 
of accounts receivable for the 
12 months immediately pre-
ceding the month in which the 
loss or damage occurs; and 
(ii) We will adjust that total for any 
normal 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
amount of accounts receivable 
for the month in which the loss 
or damage occurred or for any 
demonstrated variance from 
the average for that month. 
(b) The following will be deducted from 
the total amount of accounts 
receivable, however that amount is 
established: 
(i)
The amount of the accounts for 
which there is no loss or dam-
age; 
(ii) The amount of the accounts 
that you are able to reestablish 
or collect; 
(iii) An amount to allow for proba-
ble bad debts that you are nor-
mally unable to collect; and 
(iv) All unearned interest and ser-
vice charges. 
e.
Our payment for loss of or damage to per-
sonal property of others will only be for the 
account of the owners of the property. We 
may adjust losses with the owners of lost or 
damaged property if other than you. If we 
pay the owners, such payments will satisfy 
your claims against us for the owners' prop-
erty. We will not pay the owners more than 
their financial interest in the Covered Prop-
erty.

arising from claims of owners of property.

(2) An appraisal award has been made.
h.
A party wall is a wall that separates and is 
common to adjoining buildings that are 
owned by different parties. In settling cov-
ered losses involving a party wall, we will 
pay a proportion of the loss to the party wall 
based on your interest in the wall in pro-
portion to the interest of the owner of the ad-
joining building. However, if you elect to re-
pair or replace your building and the owner 
of the adjoining building elects not to repair 
or replace that building, we will pay you the 
full value of the loss to the party wall, sub-
ject to all applicable policy provisions in-
cluding Limits of Insurance and all other 
provisions of this Loss Payment Condition. 
Our payment under the provisions of this 
paragraph does not alter any right of subro-
gation we may have against any entity, in-
cluding the owner or insurer of the adjoining 
building, and does not alter the terms of the 
Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against 
Others To Us Condition in this policy.
6.
Recovered Property 
If either you or we recover any property after 
loss settlement, that party must give the other 
prompt notice. At your option, you may retain 
the property. But then you must return to us the 
amount we paid to you for the property. We will 
pay recovery expenses and the expenses to re-
pair the recovered property, subject to the Lim-
its of Insurance of Section I – Property.

"operations," in whole or in part, by using 
damaged or undamaged property (includ-
ing merchandise or stock) at the described

property; or

treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any 
way respond to or assess the effects of 
"pollutants."

short the "period of restoration." 
10. "Pollutants" means any solid, liquid, gaseous or

icals and waste. Waste includes materials to be

smoke; aircraft or vehicles; riot or civil commo-

ter damage. 
a.
Sinkhole collapse means the sudden sink-
ing or collapse of land into underground 
empty spaces created by the action of wa-
ter on limestone or dolomite. This cause of 
loss does not include: 
(1) The cost of filling sinkholes; or

NIA-400 BOP 01 16
Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its per-
mission.
Page 36 of 39
(2) Accidental discharge or leakage of wa-
ter or waterborne material as the direct 
result of the breaking apart or cracking 
of a water or sewer pipe that is located 
off the described premises and is part 
of a municipal potable water supply 
system or municipal sanitary sewer 
system, if the breakage or cracking is 
caused by wear and tear.    
But water damage does not include loss or 
damage otherwise excluded under the 
terms of the Water Exclusion. Therefore, for 
example, there is no coverage in the situa-
tion in which discharge or leakage of water 
results from the breaking apart or cracking 
of a pipe which was caused by or related to 
weather induced flooding, even if wear and 
tear contributed to the breakage or crack-
ing. As another example, and also in accor-
dance with the terms of the Water Exclu-
sion, there is no coverage for loss or 
damage caused by or related to weather-in-
duced flooding which follows or is exacer-
bated by pipe breakage or cracking attribut-
able to wear and tear. 
To the extent that accidental discharge or 
leakage of water falls within the criteria set 
forth in c.(1) or c.(2) of this definition of 
"specified causes of loss," such water is not 
subject to the provisions of the Water Ex-
clusion which preclude coverage for sur-
face water or water under the ground sur-
face.
13. "Stock" means merchandise held in storage or 
for sale, raw materials and in-process or fin-
ished goods, including supplies used in their

scribed, printed or written:
a.
Documents; 
b.
Manuscripts; and 
c.
Records; 
including abstracts, books, deeds, drawings, 
films, maps or mortgages.
But "valuable papers and records" does not 
mean "money" or "securities."

H.
Other Insurance 
1.
If there is other insurance covering the same 
loss or damage, we will pay only for the amount 
of covered loss or damage in excess of the 
amount due from that other insurance, whether 
you can collect on it or not. But we will not pay 
more than the applicable Limit of Insurance of 
Section I – Property. 
2.
Business Liability Coverage is excess over:
a.
Any other insurance that insures for direct 
physical loss or damage; or
b.
Any other primary insurance available to 
you covering liability for damages arising 
out of the premises or operations for which 
you have been added as an additional in-
sured. 
3.
When this insurance is excess, we will have no 
duty under Business Liability Coverage to de-
fend any claim or "suit" that any other insurer 
has a duty to defend. If no other insurer de-
fends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be 
entitled to the insured's rights against all those 
other insurers. 
I.
Premiums 
1.
The first Named Insured shown in the Declara-
tions: 
a.
Is responsible for the payment of all premi-
ums; and 
b.
Will be the payee for any return premiums 
we pay. 
2.
The premium shown in the Declarations was 
computed based on rates in effect at the time 
the policy was issued. On each renewal, con-
tinuation or anniversary of the effective date of 
this policy, we will compute the premium in ac-
cordance with our rates and rules then in effect. 
3.
With our consent, you may continue this policy 
in force by paying a continuation premium for 
each successive one-year period. The premium 
must be: 
a.
Paid to us prior to the anniversary date; and 
b.
Determined in accordance with Paragraph 
2. above. 
Our forms then in effect will apply. If you do not 
pay the continuation premium, this policy will 
expire on the first anniversary date that we have 
not received the premium. 
4.
Undeclared exposures or change in your busi-
ness operation, acquisition or use of locations 
may occur during the policy period that are not 
shown in the Declarations. If so, we may require 
an additional premium. That premium will be de-
termined in accordance with our rates and rules 
then in effect. 
J.
Premium Audit 
1.
This policy is subject to audit if a premium des-
ignated as an advance premium is shown in the 
Declarations. We will compute the final pre-
mium due when we determine your actual ex-
posures. 
2.
Premium shown in this policy as advance pre-
mium is a deposit premium only. At the close of 
each audit period we will compute the earned 
premium for that period and send notice to the 
first Named Insured. The due date for audit pre-
miums is the date shown as the due date on the 
bill. If the sum of the advance and audit premi-
ums paid for the policy period is greater than the 
earned premium, we will return the excess to 
the first Named Insured. 
3.
The first Named Insured must keep records of 
the information we need for premium computa-
tion, and send us copies at such times as we 
may request. 
K.

To Us 
1.
Applicable to Businessowners Property Cover-
age: 
If any person or organization to or for whom we 
make payment under this policy has rights to re-
cover damages from another, those rights are 
transferred to us to the extent of our payment.

necessary to secure our rights and must do 
nothing after loss to impair them. But you may 
waive your rights against another party in writ-
ing: 
a.
Prior to a loss to your Covered Property.

shipping receipts limiting the liability of carriers. 
This will not restrict your insurance.
2.
Applicable to Businessowners Liability Cover-
age: 
If the insured has rights to recover all or part of 
any payment we have made under this policy, 
those rights are transferred to us. The insured 
must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our 
request, the insured will bring "suit" or transfer 
those rights to us and help us enforce them. 
This condition does not apply to Medical Ex-
penses Coverage. 
L.
Transfer Of Your Rights And Duties Under This 
Policy 
Your rights and duties under this policy may not be 
transferred without our written consent except in the 
case of death of an individual Named Insured.

tative. Until your legal representative is appointed, 
anyone having proper temporary custody of your 
property will have your rights and duties but only 
with respect to that property.

No coverage is provided by these coverage highlights. If there is any conflict between the policy and the 
coverage highlights above, the provisions of the policy will prevail. Please read your policy and endorsements 
for a complete explanation and understanding of the coverage.
THIS ENDORSEMENT CHANGES THE POLICY.  PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.
BUSINESSOWNERS ENHANCEMENT ENDORSEMENT
This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:
BUSINESSOWNERS COVERAGE FORM
Section I - Property, Paragraph A. Coverage, 5. Additional Coverage, is revised as follows:
1.
The most we will pay in Paragraph 5. c. Fire Department Service Charge is increased from $2,500 to 
$25,000. 
2.
The "period of restoration" in Paragraph 5. f. (1) Business Income (b) is increased from 12 consecutive 
months to 18 consecutive months and ordinary payroll is increased from 60 to 120 days. 
3.
Ordinary payroll expenses in Paragraph 5. f. (1) Business Income (d) (i) is deleted and replaced by 
the following: 
(i)
Means payroll expenses for all your employees except:
i. 
Employees under contract; and 
ii. 
Additional Exemptions shown in the Declarations as:

Job Classifications; or

Employees.
4.
The "period of restoration" in Paragraph 5. g. Extra Expense (4) is increased from 12 to 18 consecutive 
months.
5.
The most we will pay for each location under Paragraph 5. h. Pollutant Clean Up and Removal is 
increased from $10,000 to $25,000.
6.
The Additional Coverage under Paragraph 5. l. Increased Cost Of Construction is replaced in its 
entirety by the following: 
5. I. 
A. Ordinance or Law Coverage 
If a Covered Cause of Loss occurs to a building or buildings included as Covered Property as 
described under Paragraph A.1.a of this Policy, the Ordinance or Law Coverage will pay, 
subject to the terms, limits and conditions set forth within Section 5. I., the amounts set forth 
below. 
B. Application Of Ordinance or Law Coverage
The Ordinance or Law Coverage applies only if both B.1. and B.2. are satisfied and is then 
subject to the qualifications set forth in B.3.
1.
The ordinance or law:
a.
Regulates the construction or repair of a building or buildings, or establishes 
zoning or land use requirements at the described premise; and 

NIA-402 BOP 05 20
Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its 
permission.
Page 3 of 10
b.
Is in force at the time of loss.
But the Ordinance or Law Coverage under this endorsement applies only in response to the 
minimum requirements of the ordinance or law. Losses and costs incurred in complying with 
recommended actions or standards that exceed actual requirements are not covered under 
Section 5. I.
2.
The building or buildings sustain direct physical damage:
a.
That is covered under this policy and such damage results in enforcement of the 
ordinance or law; or 
b.
That is covered under this policy and direct physical damage that is not covered 
under this policy, and the damage to the building or buildings in its entirety results 
in enforcement of the ordinance or law.
c.
But if the damage is not covered under this policy, and such damage is the subject 
of the ordinance or law, then there is no coverage under this Ordinance or Law 
Coverage even if the building or buildings has also sustained covered direct 
physical damage.
3.
If the situation described in B.2.b. above occurs, we will not pay the full amount of loss 
otherwise payable under the terms of the Ordinance or Law Coverage. Instead, we will 
pay a proportion of such loss; meaning the proportion that the covered direct physical 
damage bears to the total direct physical damage. (Section G. of this Ordinance or Law 
Coverage provides an example of this procedure.)
However, if the covered direct physical damage alone would have resulted in enforcement 
of an ordinance or law, then we will pay the full amount of loss otherwise payable under 
terms of the Ordinance or Law Coverage.
C. 
 We will not pay under the Ordinance or Law Coverage for:
1.
Enforcement of any ordinance or law which requires the repair, replacement, 
reconstruction, remodeling or remediation of property due to contamination by 
"pollutants" or due to the presence, growth, proliferation, spread of any activity of 
"fungi", wet or dry rot or bacteria; or
2.
The costs associated with the enforcement of any ordinance or law which requires any 
insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or 
neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of "pollutants", "fungi", wet 
or dry rot or bacteria.
D.
Coverage Exclusions 
1.
Coverage 1 – Coverage For Loss To The Undamaged Portion Of The Building 
With respect to a building or buildings that has sustained covered direct physical 
damage, we will pay for the loss in value of the undamaged portion of the building or 
buildings as a consequence of enforcement of an ordinance or law that requires 
demolition of undamaged parts of the same building. The most that we will pay for loss 
to the undamaged portion of the building(s) is 25% of the Building Limit of Insurance 
or $150,000 whichever is less.  If a building or buildings that has sustained covered 
direct physical loss is covered under a blanket Limit of Insurance which applies to more

the covered building(s).

of the actual cash value of the property subject to the replacement cost coverage, 
if any, unless we extend the time period for good cause.

G. Example of Proportionate Loss Payment for Ordinance or Law Coverage Losses 
(procedure as set forth in Section B.3. of this Section)
Assume:

Wind is a Covered Cause of Loss. Flood is an excluded Cause of Loss

The building has a value of $200,000

NIA-402 BOP 05 20
Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its 
permission.
Page 6 of 10

Total direct physical damage to building: $100,000

The ordinance or law in this jurisdiction is enforced when building damage equals or 
exceeds 50% of the building's value

Portion of direct physical damage that is covered (caused by wind): $30,000

Portion of direct physical damage that is not covered (caused by flood): $70,000

Loss under Ordinance or Law Coverage: $60,000
Step 1:
Determine the proportion that the covered direct physical damage bears to the total direct 
physical damage.
$30,000  $100,000 = .30
Step 2:
Apply that proportion to the Ordinance or Law loss.
$60,000 x .30 = $18,000
In this example, the most we will pay under this Ordinance or Law Coverage is $18,000, subject 
to the applicable Limit of Insurance and any other applicable provisions.

ous to human life, property or infrastructure and 
is committed by an individual or individuals as

ment by coercion.
If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist 
acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance 
Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year and we 
have met our insurer deductible under the Terror-
ism Risk Insurance Act, we shall not be liable for 
the payment of any portion of the amount of such

The total of insured damage to all types of property exceeds $25,000,000 (valued 
in US dollars). In determining whether the $25,000,000 threshold is exceeded, we will 
include all insured damage sustained by property of all persons and entities affected by 
the terrorism and business interruption losses sustained by owners or occupants of the 
damaged property. For the purpose of this provision, insured damage means damage

which the threshold will apply for the purpose of determining whether this exclusion will 
apply to that incident.

Exception Covering Certain Fire Losses

erty.  Therefore, for example, the coverage does not apply to insurance provided under 
Business Income and/or Extra Expense coverage forms or endorsements which apply to 
those forms, or to the legal liability Coverage For or the Leasehold Interest Coverage Form.

SECTION II – COVERED AUTOS LIABILITY 
COVERAGE
A. Coverage
We will pay all sums an "insured" legally must pay 
as damages because of "bodily injury" or "property 
damage" to which this insurance applies, caused 
by an "accident" and resulting from the ownership, 
maintenance or use of a covered "auto".
We will also pay all sums an "insured" legally must 
pay as a "covered pollution cost or expense" to 
which this insurance applies, caused by an 
"accident" and resulting from the ownership, 
maintenance or use of covered "autos". However, 
we will only pay for the "covered pollution cost or 
expense" if there is either "bodily injury" or 
"property damage" to which this insurance applies 
that is caused by the same "accident".
We have the right and duty to defend any 
"insured" against a "suit" asking for such damages 
or a "covered pollution cost or expense". However, 
we have no duty to defend any "insured" against a 
"suit" seeking damages for "bodily injury" or 
"property damage" or a "covered pollution cost or 
expense" to which this insurance does not apply. 
We may investigate and settle any claim or "suit" 
as we consider appropriate. Our duty to defend or 
settle ends when the Covered Autos Liability 
Coverage Limit of Insurance has been exhausted 
by payment of judgments or settlements.
1. Who Is An Insured
The following are "insureds":
a. You for any covered "auto".
b. Anyone 
else 
while 
using 
with 
your 
permission a covered "auto" you own, hire 
or borrow except:
(1) The owner or anyone else from whom 
you hire or borrow a covered "auto".
This exception does not apply if the 
covered "auto" is a "trailer" connected to 
a covered "auto" you own.

CA 00 01 10 13

(2) Your "employee" if the covered "auto" is 
owned by that "employee" or a member 
of his or her household. 
(3) Someone using a covered "auto" while 
he or she is working in a business of 
selling, servicing, repairing, parking or 
storing "autos" unless that business is 
yours. 
(4) Anyone other than your "employees", 
partners (if you are a partnership), 
members (if you are a limited liability 
company) or a lessee or borrower or 
any of their "employees", while moving 
property to or from a covered "auto".
(5) A partner (if you are a partnership) or a 
member (if you are a limited liability 
company) for a covered "auto" owned by 
him or her or a member of his or her 
household.
c. Anyone liable for the conduct of an 
"insured" described above but only to the 
extent of that liability.
2. Coverage Extensions
a. Supplementary Payments
We will pay for the "insured":
(1) All expenses we incur.

(including bonds for related traffic law 
violations) required because of an 
"accident" we cover. We do not have to 
furnish these bonds. 
(3) The 
cost 
of 
bonds 
to 
release 
attachments in any "suit" against the 
"insured" we defend, but only for bond 
amounts within our Limit of Insurance. 
(4) All reasonable expenses incurred by the 
"insured" at our request, including actual 
loss of earnings up to $250 a day 
because of time off from work. 
(5) All court costs taxed against the 
"insured" in any "suit" against the 
"insured" we defend. However, these 
payments do not include attorneys' fees 
or attorneys' expenses taxed against the 
"insured".
(6) All interest on the full amount of any 
judgment that accrues after entry of the 
judgment in any "suit" against the 
"insured" we defend, but our duty to pay 
interest ends when we have paid, 
offered to pay or deposited in court the 
part of the judgment that is within our 
Limit of Insurance. 
These payments will not reduce the Limit of 
Insurance.
b. Out-of-state Coverage Extensions
While a covered "auto" is away from the 
state where it is licensed, we will:
(1) Increase the Limit of Insurance for 
Covered Autos Liability Coverage to 
meet 
the 
limits 
specified 
by 
a 
compulsory or financial responsibility 
law of the jurisdiction where the covered 
"auto" is being used. This extension 
does not apply to the limit or limits 
specified by any law governing motor 
carriers of passengers or property.
(2) Provide the minimum amounts and 
types of other coverages, such as no-
fault, required of out-of-state vehicles by 
the jurisdiction where the covered "auto" 
is being used.

the same elements of loss because of 
these extensions.

SECTION IV – BUSINESS AUTO CONDITIONS
The following conditions apply in addition to the 
Common Policy Conditions: 
A. Loss Conditions 
1. Appraisal For Physical Damage Loss 
If you and we disagree on the amount of "loss", 
either may demand an appraisal of the "loss". 
In this event, each party will select a competent 
appraiser. The two appraisers will select a 
competent 
and 
impartial 
umpire. 
The 
appraisers will state separately the actual cash 
value and amount of "loss". If they fail to agree, 
they will submit their differences to the umpire. 
A decision agreed to by any two will be 
binding. Each party will: 
a. Pay its chosen appraiser; and 
b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal 
and umpire equally. 
If we submit to an appraisal, we will still retain 
our right to deny the claim. 
2. Duties In The Event Of Accident, Claim, Suit 
Or Loss 
We have no duty to provide coverage under 
this 
policy 
unless 
there 
has 
been 
full 
compliance with the following duties:
a. In the event of "accident", claim, "suit" or 
"loss", you must give us or our authorized 
representative 
prompt 
notice 
of 
the 
"accident" or "loss". Include: 
(1) How, when and where the "accident" or 
"loss" occurred; 
(2) The "insured's" name and address; and 
(3) To the extent possible, the names and 
addresses of any injured persons and 
witnesses. 
b. Additionally, you and any other involved 
"insured" must: 
(1) Assume 
no 
obligation, 
make 
no 
payment or incur no expense without 
our consent, except at the "insured's" 
own cost. 
(2) Immediately send us copies of any 
request, 
demand, 
order, 
notice, 
summons 
or 
legal 
paper 
received 
concerning the claim or "suit". 
(3) Cooperate with us in the investigation or 
settlement of the claim or defense 
against the "suit".
(4) Authorize us to obtain medical records 
or other pertinent information.
(5) Submit to examination, at our expense, 
by physicians of our choice, as often as 
we reasonably require. 
c. If there is "loss" to a covered "auto" or its 
equipment, you must also do the following: 
(1) Promptly notify the police if the covered 
"auto" or any of its equipment is stolen. 
(2) Take all reasonable steps to protect the 
covered "auto" from further damage. 
Also keep a record of your expenses for 
consideration in the settlement of the 
claim. 
(3) Permit us to inspect the covered "auto" 
and records proving the "loss" before its 
repair or disposition. 
(4) Agree to examinations under oath at our 
request and give us a signed statement 
of your answers. 
3. Legal Action Against Us
No one may bring a legal action against us 
under this Coverage Form until: 
a. There has been full compliance with all the 
terms of this Coverage Form; and 
b. Under Covered Autos Liability Coverage, 
we agree in writing that the "insured" has an 
obligation to pay or until the amount of that 
obligation has finally been determined by 
judgment after trial. No one has the right 
under this policy to bring us into an action 
to determine the "insured's" liability.

4. Loss Payment – Physical Damage 
Coverages
At our option, we may: 
a. Pay for, repair or replace damaged or 
stolen property; 
b. Return the stolen property, at our expense. 
We will pay for any damage that results to 
the "auto" from the theft; or 
c. Take all or any part of the damaged or 
stolen property at an agreed or appraised 
value. 
If we pay for the "loss", our payment will 
include the applicable sales tax for the 
damaged or stolen property.
5. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against 
Others To Us 
If any person or organization to or for whom we 
make payment under this Coverage Form has 
rights to recover damages from another, those 
rights are transferred to us. That person or 
organization must do everything necessary to 
secure our rights and must do nothing after 
"accident" or "loss" to impair them.
B. General Conditions
1. Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the "insured" or the 
"insured's" estate will not relieve us of any 
obligations under this Coverage Form. 
2. Concealment, Misrepresentation Or Fraud
This Coverage Form is void in any case of 
fraud by you at any time as it relates to this 
Coverage Form. It is also void if you or any 
other "insured", at any time, intentionally 
conceals or misrepresents a material fact 
concerning: 
a. This Coverage Form; 
b. The covered "auto"; 
c. Your interest in the covered "auto"; or 
d. A claim under this Coverage Form. 
3. Liberalization
If we revise this Coverage Form to provide 
more coverage without additional premium 
charge, your policy will automatically provide 
the additional coverage as of the day the 
revision is effective in your state. 
4. No Benefit To Bailee – Physical Damage 
Coverages
We will not recognize any assignment or grant 
any coverage for the benefit of any person or 
organization holding, storing or transporting 
property for a fee regardless of any other 
provision of this Coverage Form. 
5. Other Insurance
a. For any covered "auto" you own, this 
Coverage 
Form 
provides 
primary 
insurance. For any covered "auto" you don't 
own, the insurance provided by this 
Coverage Form is excess over any other 
collectible insurance. However, while a 
covered "auto" which is a "trailer" is 
connected to another vehicle, the Covered 
Autos Liability Coverage this Coverage 
Form provides for the "trailer" is: 
(1) Excess while it is connected to a motor 
vehicle you do not own; or 
(2) Primary while it is connected to a 
covered "auto" you own. 
b. For Hired Auto Physical Damage Coverage, 
any covered "auto" you lease, hire, rent or 
borrow is deemed to be a covered "auto" 
you own. However, any "auto" that is 
leased, hired, rented or borrowed with a 
driver is not a covered "auto".
c. Regardless of the provisions of Paragraph 
a. above, this Coverage Form's Covered 
Autos Liability Coverage is primary for any 
liability 
assumed 
under 
an 
"insured 
contract".
d. When this Coverage Form and any other 
Coverage Form or policy covers on the 
same basis, either excess or primary, we 
will pay only our share. Our share is the 
proportion that the Limit of Insurance of our 
Coverage Form bears to the total of the 
limits of all the Coverage Forms and 
policies covering on the same basis. 
6. Premium Audit
a. The estimated premium for this Coverage 
Form is based on the exposures you told us 
you would have when this policy began. We 
will compute the final premium due when 
we determine your actual exposures. The 
estimated total premium will be credited 
against the final premium due and the first 
Named Insured will be billed for the 
balance, if any. The due date for the final 
premium or retrospective premium is the 
date shown as the due date on the bill. If 
the estimated total premium exceeds the 
final premium due, the first Named Insured 
will get a refund. 
b. If this policy is issued for more than one 
year, the premium for this Coverage Form 
will be computed annually based on our 
rates or premiums in effect at the beginning 
of each year of the policy.

Form,

The coverage territory is: 
(1) The United States of America; 
(2) The territories and possessions of the

rented

or less, 
provided that the "insured's" responsibility to 
pay damages is determined in a "suit" on the 
merits, in the United States of America, the 
territories and possessions of the United States 
of America, Puerto Rico or Canada, or in a 
settlement we agree to.
We also cover "loss" to, or "accidents" 
involving, a covered "auto" while being 
transported between any of these places.
8. Two Or More Coverage Forms Or Policies 
Issued By Us
If this Coverage Form and any other Coverage 
Form or policy issued to you by us or any 
company affiliated with us applies to the same 
"accident", the aggregate maximum Limit of 
Insurance under all the Coverage Forms or 
policies shall not exceed the highest applicable 
Limit of Insurance under any one Coverage 
Form or policy. This condition does not apply to 
any Coverage Form or policy issued by us or 
an affiliated company specifically to apply as 
excess insurance over this Coverage Form.

exclusion is added:
Exclusion Of Terrorism
We will not pay for "any injury, damage, loss or 
expense" 
caused 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
by 
"terrorism", including action in hindering or 
defending against an actual or expected incident 
of "terrorism". "Any injury, damage, loss or 
expense" is excluded regardless of any other 
cause or event that contributes concurrently or in 
any sequence to such injury, damage, loss or 
expense. But this exclusion applies only when 
one or more of the following are attributed to 
an incident of "terrorism":
1. The "terrorism" is carried out by means of the 
dispersal or application of radioactive material, 
or through the use of a nuclear weapon or 
device that involves or produces a nuclear 
reaction, 
nuclear 
radiation 
or

contamination; or

2. Radioactive material is released, and it 
appears that one purpose of the "terrorism" 
was to release such material; or
3. The "terrorism" is carried out by means of the 
dispersal or application of pathogenic or 
poisonous biological or chemical materials; or
4. Pathogenic or poisonous biological or chemical 
materials are released, and it appears that one 
purpose of the "terrorism" was to release such 
materials; or
5. The total of insured damage to all types of 
property exceeds $25,000,000. In determining 
whether 
the 
$25,000,000 
threshold 
is 
exceeded, we will include all insured damage 
sustained by property of all persons and 
entities 
affected 
by 
the 
"terrorism" 
and 
business interruption losses sustained by 
owners or occupants of the damaged property. 
For the purpose of this provision, insured 
damage means damage that is covered by any

Multiple incidents of "terrorism" which occur within 
a 72-hour period and appear to be carried out in 
concert or to have a related purpose or common 
leadership will be deemed to be one incident, for 
the purpose of determining whether the thresholds 
in Paragraphs B.5. and B.6. are exceeded.
With respect to this exclusion, Paragraphs B.5. 
and B.6. describe the thresholds used to measure 
the magnitude of an incident of "terrorism" and the 
circumstances in which the threshold will apply, for 
the purpose of determining whether this exclusion 
will apply to that incident. When the exclusion 
applies to an incident of "terrorism", there is no 
coverage under this Coverage Form, Policy or any 
applicable endorsement.

reimbursement after "loss" caused directly or 
indirectly by "terrorism", including action in 
hindering or defending against an actual or 
expected 
incident 
of 
"terrorism". 
But 
this 
exclusion applies only when one or more of 
the following are attributed to an incident of 
"terrorism":
1. The "terrorism" is carried out by means of the 
dispersal or application of radioactive material, 
or through the use of a nuclear weapon or 
device that involves or produces a nuclear 
reaction, 
nuclear 
radiation 
or 
radioactive 
contamination; or
2. Radioactive material is released, and it 
appears that one purpose of the "terrorism" 
was to release such material; or
3. The "terrorism" is carried out by means of the 
dispersal or application of pathogenic or 
poisonous biological or chemical materials; or
4. Pathogenic or poisonous biological or chemical 
materials are released, and it appears that one 
purpose of the "terrorism" was to release such 
materials; or
5. The total of insured damage to all types of 
property exceeds $25,000,000. In determining 
whether 
the 
$25,000,000 
threshold 
is 
exceeded, we will include all insured damage 
sustained by property of all persons and 
entities 
affected 
by 
the 
"terrorism" 
and 
business interruption losses sustained by 
owners or occupants of the damaged property. 
For the purpose of this provision, insured 
damage means damage that is covered by any 
insurance plus damage that would be covered 
by any insurance but for the application of any 
terrorism exclusions.
Multiple incidents of "terrorism" which occur within 
a 72-hour period and appear to be carried out in 
concert or to have a related purpose or common 
leadership will be deemed to be one incident, for 
the purpose of determining whether the threshold 
in Paragraph C.5. is exceeded.

With respect to this exclusion, Paragraph C.5. 
describes the threshold used to measure the 
magnitude of an incident of "terrorism" and the 
circumstances in which the threshold will apply, for 
the purpose of determining whether this exclusion 
will apply to that incident. When the exclusion 
applies to an incident of "terrorism", there is no 
coverage under this Coverage Form, Policy or any 
applicable endorsement.
D. In the event of any incident of "terrorism" that is 
not subject to the exclusion in Paragraph B. or C., 
coverage does not apply to "any injury, damage, 
loss or expense" that is otherwise excluded under 
this Coverage Form, Policy or any applicable 
endorsement.

this coverage for any element of "loss" for 
which payment has been made by or for

compensation, disability benefits or similar law. 
E. Changes In Conditions

adding the following:

by personal service or certified mail if 
the "insured" brings an action against 
the 
owner 
or 
operator 
of 
such 
"uninsured motor vehicle"; 
(2) Within a reasonable time, make all 
pleadings and depositions available for 
copying by us or furnish us copies at our 
expense; and 
(3) Provide us with proof that the limits of 
insurance under any applicable liability 
bonds or policies have been exhausted 
by 
payment 
of

2. Legal Action Against Us is replaced by the

Legal Action Against Us

full compliance with all the terms of this 
Coverage 
Form 
and 
with 
respect 
to 
Paragraphs a., c. and d. of the definition of

years from the date of the "accident":
a. Agreement as to the amount due under this 
insurance has been concluded;

us within a reasonable time after the

the other motorist is uninsured. In no event 
will such notice be required before two 
years from the date of the accident. Failure 
of the "insured" or his or her representative 
to give us such notice of the "suit" will 
relieve us of our obligations under this

notice prejudices our rights.

Others To Us

share of the "loss" that must be paid

a primary basis. Our share is the 
proportion that our limit of liability bears 
to the total of all applicable limits of 
liability for coverage on a primary basis.
(2) On an excess basis, we will pay only our 
share of the "loss" that must be paid

that 
"insured", 
the

party 
will 
bear 
the 
expenses of the arbitrator equally. 
b. Unless 
both 
parties 
agree 
otherwise, 
arbitration will take place in the county in

Subject to the terms and conditions of the policy to which this endorsement is attached, coverage is amended to include 
a “Claim” for “Damages” resulting from a “Wrongful Act” committed on or after the Retroactive Date(s) identified within 
this endorsement and before this policy's inception date, and first reported to the Company during this policy's period.
This insurance does not apply to a “Claim” or “Claims” for “Damages” resulting from a “Wrongful Act” or “Wrongful Acts” 
that any “Member” knew or should have known prior to this policy's inception date would lead to a “Claim” or “Suit”.
This insurance will not apply to any “Claim” for “Damages” resulting from any “Wrongful Act” that are covered by any 
other insurance with the same or greater liability amount as set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations of this policy which 
the “Member” purchases in the future, has purchased in the past or that would be covered but for the exhaustion of the 
amount of insurance previously purchased and applicable to such “Claim" for “Damages”.
This endorsement will not serve to increase our limit of insurance.  If no limit is shown, then no coverage is afforded.  Our 
limits for a “Claim” for “Damages” resulting from a “Wrongful Act” committed on or after the Retroactive Date(s) identified 
within this endorsement and before the policy's inception date, and first reported to the Company during this policy 
period, are shown in the above Limits Schedule. 
Upon termination of this Prior Wrongful Acts Endorsement and in consideration of an additional premium charge of 35% 
of the full annual premium, an Extended Reporting Period Endorsement is available. If either the Company or the 
“Member” cancels or declines to renew this policy, then pursuant to the Extended Reporting Period, the “Member” shall 
have the period of time designated on the Extended Reporting Period form following the effective date of such 
cancellation or non-renewal in which to give written notice to the Company of “Claims” first made against the “Member” 
during the Extended Reporting Period and arising out of any “Wrongful Act” or “Wrongful Acts” committed prior to this 
policy's inception date.
A written request for the Extended Reporting Period together with payment of the appropriate premium must be made 
within thirty (30) days after the cancellation or non-renewal of the policy. This additional premium shall be fully earned 
at the inception of the extended reporting period. The Extended Reporting Period Endorsement is not cancelable. The 
Extended Reporting Period will not apply to any “Claim” for “Damages” resulting from any “Wrongful Act” that any 
Member knew or should have known prior to that written request would lead to a “Claim” or “Suit”.
At the Company's option, this right to purchase the Extended Reporting Period Endorsement may not apply if: 
(a) this policy is canceled by the Company for non-payment of premium; or 
(b) this policy is succeeded immediately with no gap in coverage by another policy.

A. Disclosure Of Premium
In accordance with the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, we are required to provide you with a notice 
disclosing the portion of your premium, if any, attributable to coverage for terrorist acts certified under that Act. 
The portion of your premium attributable to such coverage is shown in the Schedule of this endorsement or in 
the policy Declarations.
B. Disclosure Of Federal Participation In Payment Of Terrorism Losses
The United States Government, Department of the Treasury, will pay a share of terrorism losses insured under 
the federal program. The federal share equals a percentage (as shown in Part II of the Schedule of this 
endorsement or in the policy Declarations) of that portion of the amount of such insured losses that exceeds the 
applicable insurer retention. However, if aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the 
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed $100 billion in a calendar year, the Treasury shall not make any payment 
for any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion.
C. Cap On Insurer Participation In Payment Of Terrorism Losses
If aggregate insured losses attributable to terrorist acts certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act exceed 
$100 billion in a calendar year and we have met our insurer deductible under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, 
we shall not be liable for the payment of any portion of the amount of such losses that exceeds $100 billion, and 
in such case insured losses up to that amount are subject to pro rata allocation in accordance with procedures 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury. 
D. Possibility Of Additional Or Return Premium
The premium for certified acts of terrorism coverage is calculated based in part on the federal participation in 
payment of terrorism losses as set forth in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The federal program established 
by the Act is scheduled to terminate at the end of the year specified in Part I of the Schedule of this endorsement, 
unless extended by the federal government. If the federal program terminates or if the level or terms of federal 
participation change, the estimated premium shown in (B) in Part I of the Schedule may not be appropriate.
If this policy contains a Conditional Exclusion, continuation of coverage for certified acts of terrorism, or 
termination of such coverage, will be determined upon disposition of the federal program, subject to the terms 
and conditions of the Conditional Exclusion. If this policy does not contain a Conditional Exclusion, coverage for 
certified acts of terrorism will continue. In either case, when disposition of the federal program is determined, we 
will recalculate the premium shown in (B) in Part I of the Schedule and will charge additional premium or refund 
excess premium, if indicated.
If we notify you of an additional premium charge, the additional premium will be due as specified in such notice.

Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form
Directors and Officers Liability Policy
This Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form sets forth coverage for Directors and Officers Liability. When 
the Declarations Page to this policy indicates that the Directors and Officers Liability Policy has been purchased, the 
Directors and Officers Liability coverage will be included within the scope of liability coverage provided within the 
Board and Executive Liability insurance.
Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what 
is and is not covered.
Throughout this policy, the words “you” and “your” refer to the entity or entities shown as the Named Member in Item 
1 of the Declarations to this policy. The words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the Company providing this coverage.
The word “Member” means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II - Who Is A Member of the 
Directors and Officers Liability Policy.
Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section V - Definitions of the 
Directors and Officers Liability Policy. 
SECTION I - COVERAGE
1.
INSURING AGREEMENT
A.
This Directors and Officers Liability Policy shall, subject to the limit of insurance set forth in the Declarations, 
pay on behalf of a “Member” all sums which the “Member” shall become legally obligated to pay as 
“Damages” for “Claims” resulting from any “Wrongful Act” of the “Member” or of any other person for whose 
“Wrongful Act” the “Member” is legally responsible, but only if such “Wrongful Act” is committed during the 
policy period. All “Damages” for a “Claim” or “Claims” resulting from the same “Wrongful Act” or a series of 
continuous or interrelated “Wrongful Acts” will be considered as arising out of one “Wrongful Act” which 
shall be deemed to have been committed on the date of the first such “Wrongful Act”.
B.
We shall have the right and duty to defend any “Claim” against a “Member” arising from a “Wrongful Act”, 
subject to the terms and provisions of this Directors and Officers Liability Policy. Our right and duty to 
defend end when we have used up the applicable Limit of Insurance in the payment of settlements and 
judgments. We may at our discretion investigate any allegation of a “Wrongful Act” and settle any “Claim” 
that may result. The “Member” shall cooperate in providing all information as we may reasonably require. 
C.
No “Member” will, except at that “Member’s” own cost, voluntarily make a payment, admit liability for or 
settle any “Claim” or “Claims” or incur any “Defense Costs” without our prior written consent. We shall not 
be liable with respect to any settlement or “Defense Costs” to which we have not consented in writing prior 
to that settlement or incurring of such “Defense Costs”. If we accept the defense of any “Member” to any 
“Claim” or “Claims”, we have the right to appoint counsel of our choice and to control that defense.
D.
“Defense Costs” are in addition to the applicable Limit of Insurance set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations 
shown as applicable to the Directors and Officers Each Claim and Aggregate Limit. The payment by us of 
“Defense Costs” does not reduce the applicable Limit of Insurance.

SECTION III - LIMITS OF INSURANCE
A.
Limit of Insurance
The Directors and Officers Liability Limit of Insurance as noted in Item 3 of the Declarations is the 
most we will pay for the sum of all settlements and judgments under this policy regardless of the 
number of “Members”, “Claims” presented or “suits” brought or persons or entities making a “Claim” 
or “Claims”. If a limit for “Defense Costs” is extended pursuant to an exception to an exclusion within 
Section I-Coverage, 2. Exclusions, only one such limit will be applicable to any one policy year, even 
if there are multiple “Claims” and/or claimants seeking recovery under that coverage, subject to the 
Anti-Stacking Condition within Section IV, Condition B. The applicable Limit of Insurance is subject to 
the Deductible identified in the Declarations unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this policy. 
B.
Deductible
We shall only be liable for that amount payable in settlement or satisfaction of a “Claim”, “Claims” 
or judgments arising from any “Claim” or “Claims” which is in excess of the Deductible stated in the 
Declarations applicable to this Directors and Officers Liability policy.  A single deductible shall apply 
to all amounts payable arising from all “Claims” alleging the same “Wrongful Act”. The Deductible 
will apply to “Damages” and “Defense Costs” incurred by us in the defense and/or investigation of 
a “Claim” or “Claims”. If there is no payment by us for “Damages” in any “Claim” or “Claims”, the 
Deductible will still apply to any payment by us of “Defense Costs” incurred with respect to that 
“Claim” or “Claims”.
C.
Other Payments
We will pay with respect to any “Claim” or “Claims” we defend:
1.
All expenses we incur, including but not limited to, reasonable and customary attorney’s fees, 
costs and disbursements incurred by us in the defense of any “Claim” or “Claims.”
2.
The cost of an appeal bond, attachment bond or similar bonds, but only for bond amounts 
within the applicable limit of insurance and for “Damages” which are covered under this policy. 
We do not have to apply for or furnish the bond or bonds. 
3.
“Defense Costs” incurred in the appeal of a “Claim” or “Claims” that we have defended, but 
only if the appeal of the “Claim” or “Claims” seeks “Damages” which are covered under this 
policy.

NIA-200 DO 03 25

Alliance Member Services™ (AMS). © AMS. All rights reserved.
Page 9 of 15
4.
All costs taxed against a Member in the “Claim” or “Claims”, but this does not include attorney’s 
fees or expert witness fees taxed as costs pursuant to statute.
5.
Pre-judgment interest awarded against a Member on that part of the judgment which is covered 
under this policy. If we make an offer to pay the applicable limit of insurance available under 
this policy, we will not pay any pre-judgment interest based on that period of time after the offer.
The amounts identified within “Other Payments” are in addition to the Limit of Insurance identified 
in Item 3 of the Declarations for this policy. 
SECTION IV - CONDITIONS
A.
Action Against Us
No action shall lie against us unless, as a condition precedent thereto, there shall have been full 
compliance with all of the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the “Member’s” obligation to pay 
shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the “Member” after actual trial or by 
written agreement of the “Member”, the claimant or claimants and us.
B.
Anti-Stacking
If two or more policies issued by us to you under the Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form 
apply to a “Claim”, “Claims” or “suits” for “Damages” resulting from a “Wrongful Act”; it is our intent 
that the policies do not provide any duplication or overlap of coverage for the same “Claim”, 
“Claims” or “suits”, and the combined maximum Limit of Liability under all such policies shall not 
exceed the highest applicable Limit of Liability under any one policy identified within the 
Declarations Page, regardless of the number of “Members”, claimants, “Claims” or “suits”. Any 
“Claim” or “suit” which includes multiple claimants and/or plaintiffs and which arises out of a series 
of continuous or interrelated “Wrongful Acts” will be considered as arising out of one “Wrongful 
Act”, which is deemed to have been committed on the date of the first such “Wrongful Act”, without 
regard to the status of the respective claimant, claimants, plaintiff and/or plaintiffs at the time of that 
“Wrongful Act”.
C.
Arbitration
In consideration of the premium charged, it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy shall be 
deemed to have been executed in the State of California and any interpretation of the policy related 
to construction, validity and performance of the policy shall be made in accordance with the laws of 
the State of California. 
It is further understood and agreed that all disputes which may arise under or in connection with this 
policy shall be finally settled and resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration 
Act.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the 
arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, U.S.A. 
The arbitration panel shall be made up of three (3) people.  Each party shall choose one arbitrator 
that will serve on the panel in a non-neutral capacity.  The two chosen arbitrators will select a third 
arbitrator who will be neutral.  If the chosen arbitrators are unable to select a third arbitrator within ten 
(10) days of their selection, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration 
Association.  Each arbitrator shall have experience in the insurance industry and have a legal 
background. 
Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will upon written request of the other 
party promptly provide copies of any relevant documents necessary to support any claim or defense.  
All parties shall have the discretion to examine up to three (3) witnesses per party.  Each deposition 
shall be limited to a maximum of two (2) hours.  Any objections based on privilege and/or 
confidentiality will be reserved for arbitration.  Any discovery prior to the arbitration will take place in 
a location convenient to both parties.  Upon agreement of all parties, the parties may submit briefs in 
lieu of any formal gathering for arbitrations.

The arbitrators will have the authority to award actual monetary damages only.  No punitive or 
equitable relief is authorized.  All parties shall bear their own costs for arbitration and no attorney’s 
fees or other costs shall be granted to any party. The arbitrators’ fee and administrative costs shall 
be paid, in equal parts, by the parties. 
The arbitrators’ decision shall be final and legally binding, and judgment may be entered thereon.

N.
Other Insurance
1.
The insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in 
excess of or contingent upon the absence of other insurance. When the insurance extended 
by this policy is primary and a “Member” has other insurance which is stated to be applicable 
to the loss on an excess or contingent basis only, the amount of our liability under this policy 
shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance.
When both this policy and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether 
primary, excess or contingent, we shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion 
of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below.
a.
Contribution by Equal Shares. If all of such other valid and collectible insurance 
provides for contribution by equal shares, we shall not be liable for a greater 
proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal 
share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability 
under  any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any 
amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurer or insurers then continue to 
contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each has paid its 
limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid.
b.
Contribution by Limits. If any of such other insurance does not provide for 
contribution by equal shares, we shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such 
loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the 
total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.
2.
Subject to the Anti-Stacking Condition within Condition B, no coverage shall be afforded by 
this policy if coverage for the “Claim” or “Claims” is afforded under any other policy issued by 
us to the “Organization” or to any “Member” against whom the “Claim” or “Claims” is asserted.
O.
Representations
You have represented that the representations and statements contained in the application for this 
policy are true and are the basis of which this policy has been issued. The representations and 
statements in the application for this policy are to be considered as incorporated in and constituting

application for insurance in issuing this policy and would not have issued this policy but for the 
representations and statements contained within the application.
P.
Separation of Members
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, the information contained in the application for this 
policy and any right or duty specifically assigned to the “Organization”, this insurance applies:
1.
as if each “Member” were the only “Member” to which coverage under this policy applies; 
2.
separately for each Member against whom a “Claim” or “Claims” is made; and
3.
no fact pertaining to knowledge possessed by any “Member” shall be imputed to any other 
“Member” to determine if coverage for the “Claim” or “Claims” is available.
Q.
Territory
Coverage shall extend to any “Wrongful Act” of a “Member” committed anywhere in the world, but 
only if that “Member’s” responsibility to pay “Damages” is determined in a “suit” on the merits which

is determined within the United States of  America.
R. 
Transfer of Rights of Recovery against Others to Us

policy from any other person or entity, those rights are transferred to us. The “Member” shall execute 
all documents required to effect that transfer and shall do everything that may be necessary for us to

Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form
Employment Practices Liability Policy
This Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form sets forth coverage for Employment Practices Liability. When 
the Declarations Page to this policy indicates that Employment Practices Liability has been purchased, the 
Employment Practices Liability coverage will be included within the scope of liability coverage provided within the 
Board and Executive Liability insurance.
Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what 
is and is not covered.
Throughout this policy, the words “you” and “your” refer to the entity or entities shown as the Named Member in Item 
1 of the Declarations to this policy. The words “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the Company providing this insurance.
The word “Member” means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II-Who Is A Member of the 
Employment Practices Liability Policy.
Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section V-Definitions of the 
Employment Practices Liability Policy. 
SECTION I - COVERAGE
1.
INSURING AGREEMENT
A.
This Employment Practices Liability policy shall, subject to the limit of liability set forth in the Declarations, 
pay on behalf of a “Member” all sums which the “Member” shall become legally obligated to pay as 
“Damages” for “Claims” resulting from any “Wrongful Act” of the “Member” or of any other person for 
whose “Wrongful Act” the “Member” is legally responsible, but only if such “Wrongful Act” is committed 
during the policy period. All “Damages” for a “Claim” or “Claims” resulting from the same “Wrongful Act” 
or a series of continuous or interrelated “Wrongful Acts” will be considered as arising out of one of 
“Wrongful Act”, which shall be deemed to have been committed on the date of the first such “Wrongful 
Act”.
B.
We shall have the right and duty to defend any “Claim” against a “Member” arising from a “Wrongful Act”, 
subject to the terms and provisions of this Employment Practices Liability policy. Our right and duty to 
defend end when we have used up the applicable Limit of Insurance in the payment of settlements and 
judgments. We may at our discretion investigate any allegation of a “Wrongful Act” and settle any “Claim” 
that may result. The “Member” shall cooperate in providing all information as we may reasonably require.
C.
No “Member” will, except at that Member’s own cost, voluntarily make a payment, admit liability for or 
settle any “Claim” or “Claims” or incur any “Defense Costs” without our prior written consent. We shall not 
be liable with respect to any settlement or “Defense Costs” to which we have not consented in writing 
prior to that settlement or incurring of such “Defense Costs”. If we accept the defense of any “Member” to 
any “Claim” or “Claims”, we have the right to appoint counsel of our choice to control that defense.
D.
“Defense Costs” are in addition to the applicable Limit of Insurance set forth in the Declarations shown as 
applicable to the Employment Practices Liability Each Claim and Aggregate Limit. The payment by us of 
“Defense Costs” does not reduce the applicable Limit of Insurance.

SECTION III - LIMITS OF INSURANCE
A.
Limit of Insurance
The Employment Practices Liability Limit of Insurance as noted in Item 3 of the Declarations is the 
most we will pay for the sum of all settlements and judgments under this policy regardless of the 
number of “Members”, “Claims” presented or “suits” brought or persons or entities making a “Claim” 
or “Claims”. If a limit for “Defense Costs” is extended pursuant to an exception to an Exclusion within 
Section I-Coverage, 2. Exclusions, only one such limit will be applicable to any one policy year, even 
if there are multiple “Claims” and/or claimants seeking recovery under that coverage, subject to the 
Anti-stacking Condition within Section IV, Condition B. The applicable Limit of Insurance is subject to 
the Deductible identified in the Declarations unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this policy. 
B.
Deductible
We shall only be liable for that amount payable in settlement or satisfaction of a “Claim”, “Claims” 
or judgments arising from any “Claim” or “Claims” which is in excess of the Deductible stated in the 
Declarations applicable to this Employment Practices Liability policy.  A single deductible shall 
apply to all amounts payable arising from all “Claims” alleging the same “Wrongful Act”. The 
Deductible will apply to “Damages” and “Defense Costs” incurred by us in the defense and/or 
investigation of a “Claim” or “Claims”. If there is no payment by us for “Damages” in any “Claim” or 
“Claims”, the Deductible will still apply to any payment by us of “Defense Costs”.
C.
Other Payments
We will pay with respect to any “Claim” or “Claims” we defend:
1.
All expenses we incur, including but not limited to, reasonable and customary attorney’s fees, 
costs and disbursements incurred by us in the defense of any “Claim” or “Claims.”
2.
The cost of an appeal bond, attachment bond or similar bonds, but only for bond amounts 
within the applicable limit of insurance and for “Damages” which are covered under this policy. 

NIA-200 EPL 01 25

Alliance Member Services™ (AMS). © AMS. All rights reserved.
Page 9 of 15
We do not have to apply for or furnish the bond or bonds. 
3.
“Defense Costs” incurred in the appeal of a “Claim” or “Claims” that we have defended, but 
only if the appeal of the “Claim” or “Claims” seeks “Damages” which are covered under this 
policy.
4.
All costs taxed against a Member in the “Claim” or “Claims”, but this does not include attorney’s 
fees or expert witness fees taxed as costs pursuant to statute.
5.
Pre-judgment interest awarded against a Member on that part of the judgment which is covered 
under this policy. If we make an offer to pay the applicable limit of insurance available under 
this policy, we will not pay any pre-judgment interest based on that period of time after the offer.
The amounts identified within “Other Payments” are in addition to the Limit of Insurance identified 
in Item 3 of the Declarations for this Policy. 
SECTION IV - CONDITIONS
A.
Action Against Us
No action shall lie against us unless, as a condition precedent thereto, there shall have been full 
compliance with all of the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the “Member’s” obligation to pay 
shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the “Member” after actual trial or by 
written agreement of the “Member”, the claimant or claimants and us.
B.
Anti-Stacking
If two or more policies issued by us to you under the Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form 
apply to a “Claim”, “Claims” or “suits” for “Damages” resulting from a “Wrongful Act”; it is our intent 
that the policies do not provide any duplication or overlap of coverage for the same “Claim”, 
“Claims” or “suits”, and the combined maximum Limit of Liability under all such policies shall not 
exceed the highest applicable Limit of Liability under any one policy identified within the 
Declarations Page, regardless of the number of “Members”, claimants, “Claims” or “suits”. Any 
“Claim” or suit which includes multiple claimants and/or plaintiffs and which arises out of a series 
of continuous or interrelated “Wrongful Acts” will be considered as arising out of one “Wrongful 
Act”, which is deemed to have been committed on the date of the first such “Wrongful Act”, without 
regard to the status of the respective claimant, claimants, plaintiff and/or plaintiffs at the time of that 
“Wrongful Act”.
C.
Arbitration
In consideration of the premium charged, it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy shall be 
deemed to have been executed in the State of California and any interpretation of the policy related 
to construction, validity and performance of the policy shall be made in accordance with the laws of 
the State of California. 
It is further understood and agreed that all disputes which may arise under or in connection with this 
policy shall be finally settled and resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration 
Act.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the 
arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, U.S.A. 
The arbitration panel shall be made up of three (3) people.  Each party shall choose one arbitrator 
that will serve on the panel in a non-neutral capacity.  The two chosen arbitrators will select a third 
arbitrator who will be neutral.  If the chosen arbitrators are unable to select a third arbitrator within ten 
(10) days of their selection, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration 
Association.  Each arbitrator shall have experience in the insurance industry and have a legal 
background. 
Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will upon written request of the other 
party promptly provide copies of any relevant documents necessary to support any claim or defense.

N.
Other Insurance
1. 
The insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in 
excess of or contingent upon the absence of other insurance. When the insurance extended 
by this policy is primary and a “Member” has other insurance which is stated to be applicable 
to the loss on an excess or contingent basis only, the amount of our liability under this policy 
shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance.
When both this policy and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether 
primary, excess or contingent, we shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion 
of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below.
a.
Contribution by Equal Shares.  If all of such other valid and collectible insurance 
provides for contribution by equal shares, we shall not be liable for a greater 
proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal 
share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability 
under any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any 
amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurer or insurers then continue to 
contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each has paid its 
limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid.
b.
Contribution by Limits.  If any of such other insurance does not provide for 
contribution by equal shares, we shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such 
loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the 
total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.
2.
Subject to the Anti-Stacking Condition within Condition B, no coverage shall be afforded by 
this policy if coverage for the “Claim” or “Claims” is afforded under any other policy issued by 
us to the “Organization” or to any “Member” against whom the “Claim” or “Claims” is asserted.
O.
Representations
You have represented that the representations and statements contained in the application for this 
policy are true and are the basis of which this policy has been issued. The representations and 
statements in the application for this policy are to be considered as incorporated in and constituting

application for insurance in issuing this policy and would not have issued this policy but for the 
representations and statements contained within the application.
P.
Separation of Members
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, the information contained in the application for this 
policy and any right or duty specifically assigned to the “Organization”, this insurance applies:
1.
as if each “Member” were the only “Member” to which coverage under this policy applies; 
2.
separately for each Member against whom a “Claim” or “Claims” is made; and
3.
no fact pertaining to knowledge possessed by any “Member” shall be imputed to any other 
“Member” to determine if coverage for the “Claim” or “Claims” is available.
Q.
Territory
Coverage shall extend to any “Wrongful Act” of a “Member” committed anywhere in the world, but 
only if that “Member’s” responsibility to pay “Damages” is determined in a “suit” on the merits which 
is determined within the United States of America.

This Fiduciary Liability policy shall, subject to the limit of liability set forth in the Declarations, pay on behalf

“Claims” resulting from any “Wrongful Act” of the “Member” or of any other person for whose “Wrongful 
Act” the “Member” is legally responsible, but only if such “Wrongful Act” is committed during this policy

continuous or interrelated “Wrongful Acts” will be considered as arising out of one “Wrongful Act” which 
shall be deemed to have been committed on the date of the first such “Wrongful Act”.
B.
We shall have the right and duty to defend any “Claim” against a “Member” arising from a “Wrongful Act”, 
subject to the terms and provisions of this Fiduciary Liability policy. Our right and duty to defend end when 
we have used up the applicable Limit of Insurance in the payment of settlements and judgments. We may 
at our discretion investigate any allegation of a “Wrongful Act” and settle any “Claim” that may result. The 
“Member” shall cooperate in providing all information as we may reasonably require.

No “Member” will, except at that “Member’s” own cost, voluntarily make a payment, admit liability for or 
settle any “Claim” or “Claims” or incur any “Defense Costs” without our prior written consent. We shall not 
be liable with respect to any settlement or “Defense Costs” to which we have not consented in writing 
prior to that settlement or incurring of such “Defense Costs”. If we accept the defense of any “Member” to 
any “Claim” or “Claims,” we have the right to appoint counsel of our choice and to control that defense.
D.
“Defense Costs” are in addition to the applicable Limit of Insurance set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations 
shown as applicable to the Fiduciary Liability Each Claim and Aggregate Limit. The payment by us of 
“Defense Costs” does not reduce the applicable Limit of Insurance.

SECTION III - LIMITS OF INSURANCE
A.
Limit of Insurance
The Fiduciary Liability Limit of Insurance as noted in Item 3 of the Declarations is the most we will 
pay for the sum of all settlements and judgments under this policy regardless of the number of 
“Members”, “Claims” presented or “suits” brought or persons or entities making a “Claim” or “Claims”. 
If a limit for “Defense Costs” is extended pursuant to an exception to an Exclusion within Section I-
Coverage, 2. Exclusions, only one such limit will be applicable to any one policy year, even if there 
are multiple “Claims” and/or claimants seeking recovery under that coverage, subject to the Anti-
Stacking Condition within Section IV, Condition B. The applicable Limit of Insurance is subject to the 
Deductible identified in the Declarations unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this policy. 
B.
Deductible
We shall only be liable for that amount payable in settlement or satisfaction of a “Claim”, “Claims” 
or judgments arising from any “Claim” or “Claims” which is in excess of the Deductible stated in the 
Declarations applicable to this Fiduciary Liability policy. A single deductible shall apply to all 
amounts payable arising from all “Claims” alleging the same “Wrongful Act”. The Deductible will 
apply to “Damages” and “Defense Costs” incurred by us in the defense and/or investigation of a 
“Claim” or “Claims”. If there is no payment by us for “Damages” in any “Claim” or “Claims”, the 
Deductible will still apply to any payment by us of “Defense Costs”.
C.
Other Payments
We will pay with respect to any “Claim” or “Claims” we defend:
1.
All expenses we incur, including but not limited to, reasonable and customary attorney’s fees, 
costs and disbursements incurred by us in the defense of any “Claim” or “Claims.”
2.
The cost of an appeal bond, attachment bond or similar bond, but only for bond amounts within 
the applicable limit of insurance and for “Damages” which are covered under this Fiduciary 
Liability policy. We do not have to apply for or furnish the bond or bonds. 
3.
“Defense Costs” incurred in the appeal of a “Claim” or “Claims” that we have defended, but 
only if the appeal of the “Claim” or “Claims” seeks “Damages” which are covered under this 
Fiduciary Liability policy.
4.
All costs taxed against a Member in the “Claim” or “Claims” but this does not include attorney’s 
fees or expert witness fees taxed as costs pursuant to statute.
5.
Pre-judgment interest awarded against a “Member” on that part of the judgment which is 
covered under this Fiduciary Liability policy. If we make an offer to pay the applicable limit of 
insurance available under this Fiduciary Liability policy, we will not pay any pre-judgment 
interest based on that period of time after the offer.
The amounts identified within “Other Payments” are in addition to the Limit of Liability identified in 
Item 3 of the Declarations for this Fiduciary Liability policy. 
SECTION IV - CONDITIONS

Page 9 of 15
A.
Action Against us
No action shall lie against us unless, as a condition precedent thereto, there shall have been full 
compliance with all of the terms of this policy, nor until the amount of the “Member’s” obligation to pay 
shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the “Member” after actual trial or by 
written agreement of the “Member”, the claimant or claimants and us.
B.
Anti-Stacking
If two or more policies issued by us to you under the Board and Executive Liability Coverage Form 
apply to a “Claim”, “Claims” or “suits” for “Damages” resulting from a “Wrongful Act”; it is our intent 
that the policies do not provide any duplication or overlap of coverage for the same “Claim”, 
“Claims” or “suits”, and the combined maximum Limit of Liability under all such policies shall not 
exceed the highest applicable Limit of Liability under any one policy identified within the 
Declarations Page, regardless of the number of “Members”, claimants, “Claims” or “suits”. Any 
“Claim” or “suits” which includes multiple claimants and/or plaintiffs and which arises out of a series 
of continuous or interrelated “Wrongful Acts” will be considered as arising out of one “Wrongful 
Act”, which is deemed to have been committed on the date of the first such “Wrongful Act”, without 
regard to the status of the respective claimant, claimants, plaintiff and/or plaintiffs at the time of that 
“Wrongful Act”.
C.
Arbitration
In consideration of the premium charged, it is hereby understood and agreed that this policy shall be 
deemed to have been executed in the State of California and any interpretation of the policy related 
to construction, validity and performance of the policy shall be made in accordance with the laws of 
the State of California. 
It is further understood and agreed that all disputes which may arise under or in connection with this 
policy shall be finally settled and resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Federal Arbitration 
Act.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the 
arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, U.S.A. 
The arbitration panel shall be made up of three (3) people.  Each party shall choose one arbitrator 
that will serve on the panel in a non-neutral capacity.  The two chosen arbitrators will select a third 
arbitrator who will be neutral.  If the chosen arbitrators are unable to select a third arbitrator within ten 
(10) days of their selection, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration 
Association.  Each arbitrator shall have experience in the insurance industry and have a legal 
background. 
Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will upon written request of the other 
party promptly provide copies of any relevant documents necessary to support any claim or defense.  
All parties shall have the discretion to examine up to three (3) witnesses per party.  Each deposition 
shall be limited to a maximum of two (2) hours.  Any objections based on privilege and/or 
confidentiality will be reserved for arbitration.  Any discovery prior to the arbitration will take place in 
a location convenient to both parties.  Upon agreement of all parties, the parties may submit briefs in 
lieu of any formal gathering for arbitrations.  
The arbitrators will have the authority to award actual monetary damages only.  No punitive or 
equitable relief is authorized.  All parties shall bear their own costs for arbitration and no attorney’s 
fees or other costs shall be granted to any party. The arbitrators’ fee and administrative costs shall 
be paid, in equal parts, by the parties. 
The arbitrators’ decision shall be final and legally binding, and judgment may be entered thereon.

N.
Other Insurance
1.
The insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in 
excess of or contingent upon the absence of other insurance. When the insurance extended 
by this policy is primary and a “Member” has other insurance which is stated to be applicable 
to the loss on an excess or contingent basis only, the amount of our liability under this policy 
shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance.
When both this policy and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether 
primary, excess or contingent, we shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion 
of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below.
a.
Contribution by Equal Shares.  If all of such other valid and collectible insurance 
provides for contribution by equal shares, we shall not be liable for a greater 

NIA-200 FD 01 25
Nonprofits Insurance Alliance™ and NONPROFITS OWN® are brands of 
Alliance Member Services™ (AMS). © AMS. All rights reserved.
Page 12 of 15
proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal 
share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability 
under  any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any 
amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurer or insurers then continue to 
contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each has paid its 
limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid.
b.
Contribution by Limits.  If any of such other insurance does not provide for 
contribution by equal shares, we shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such 
loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the 
total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.
2.
Subject to the Anti-Stacking Condition within Condition B, no coverage shall be afforded by 
this policy if coverage for the “Claim” or “Claims” is afforded under any other policy issued by 
us to the “Organization” or to any “Member” against whom the “Claim” or “Claims” is asserted.

Representations
You have represented that the representations and statements contained in the application for this 
policy are true and are the basis of which this policy has been issued. The representations and

representations and statements contained within the application.
P.
Separation of Members
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, the information contained in the application for this 
Fiduciary Liability policy and any right or duty specifically assigned to the “Organization”, this 
insurance applies:

Coverage Form applies; 
2.
separately for each Member against whom a “Claim” or “Claims” is made; and
3.
no fact pertaining to knowledge possessed by any “Member” shall be imputed to any other 
“Member” to determine if coverage for the “Claim” or “Claims” is available.
Q.
Territory
Coverage shall extend to any “Wrongful Act” of a “Member” committed anywhere in the world, but 
only if that “Member’s” responsibility to pay “Damages” is determined in a “suit” on the merits which 
is determined within the United States of America.

Transfer of Rights of Recovery against Others to Us
If any “Member” has rights to recover all or part of any payment or payments we have made under 
this policy from any other person or entity, those rights are transferred to us. The “Member” shall 
execute all documents required to effect that transfer and shall do everything that may be necessary 
for us to secure such rights including the execution of such documents necessary to enable us to

Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, 
duties and what is and is not covered. 
Throughout this policy the words "you" and "your" 
refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, 
and any other person or organization qualifying as a 
Named Insured under this policy. The words "we",

SECTION I – COVERAGES 
COVERAGE A – BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY 
DAMAGE LIABILITY 
1. Insuring Agreement 
a. We will pay those sums that the insured 
becomes legally obligated to pay as damages 
because of "bodily injury" or "property damage" 
to which this insurance applies. We will have 
the right and duty to defend the insured against 
any "suit" seeking those damages. However, 
we will have no duty to defend the insured 
against any "suit" seeking damages for "bodily 
injury" or "property damage" to which this 
insurance does not apply. We may, at our 
discretion, investigate any "occurrence" and 
settle any claim or "suit" that may result. But: 
(1) The amount we will pay for damages is 
limited as described in Section III – Limits 
Of Insurance; and 
(2) Our right and duty to defend ends when we 
have used up the applicable limit of 
insurance in the payment of judgments or 
settlements under Coverages A or B or 
medical expenses under Coverage C. 
No other obligation or liability to pay sums or 
perform acts or services is covered unless 
explicitly provided for under Supplementary 
Payments – Coverages A and B. 
b. This insurance applies to "bodily injury" and 
"property damage" only if: 
(1) The "bodily injury" or "property damage" is 
caused by an "occurrence" that takes place 
in the "coverage territory";
(2) The "bodily injury" or "property damage" 
occurs during the policy period; and
(3) Prior to the policy period, no insured listed 
under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is 
An Insured and no "employee" authorized 
by you to give or receive notice of an 
"occurrence" or claim, knew that the "bodily 
injury" or "property damage" had occurred, 
in whole or in part. If such a listed insured 
or authorized "employee" knew, prior to the 
policy period, that the "bodily injury" or 
"property damage" occurred, then any 
continuation, change or resumption of such 
"bodily injury" or "property damage" during 
or after the policy period will be deemed to 
have been known prior to the policy period.
c. "Bodily injury" or "property damage" which 
occurs during the policy period and was not, 
prior to the policy period, known to have 
occurred 
by 
any 
insured 
listed 
under 
Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured 
or any "employee" authorized by you to give or 
receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, 
includes 
any 
continuation, 
change 
or 
resumption of that "bodily injury" or "property 
damage" after the end of the policy period. 
d. "Bodily injury" or "property damage" will be 
deemed to have been known to have occurred 
at the earliest time when any insured listed 
under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An 
Insured or any "employee" authorized by you to 
give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or 
claim:
(1) Reports all, or any part, of the "bodily injury" 
or "property damage" to us or any other 
insurer;
(2) Receives a written or verbal demand or 
claim for damages because of the "bodily 
injury" or "property damage"; or
(3) Becomes aware by any other means that 
"bodily injury" or "property damage" has 
occurred or has begun to occur.
e. Damages because of "bodily injury" include 
damages 
claimed 
by 
any 
person 
or 
organization for care, loss of services or death 
resulting at any time from the "bodily injury".

2. Exclusions 
This insurance does not apply to: 
a. Expected Or Intended Injury 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" expected 
or intended from the standpoint of the insured. 
This exclusion does not apply to "bodily injury" 
resulting from the use of reasonable force to 
protect persons or property. 
b. Contractual Liability 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" for which 
the insured is obligated to pay damages by 
reason of the assumption of liability in a 
contract or agreement. This exclusion does not 
apply to liability for damages: 
(1) That the insured would have in the absence 
of the contract or agreement; or 
(2) Assumed in a contract or agreement that is 
an "insured contract", provided the "bodily 
injury" 
or 
"property 
damage" 
occurs 
subsequent to the execution of the contract 
or agreement. Solely for the purposes of 
liability assumed in an "insured contract", 
reasonable attorneys' fees and necessary 
litigation expenses incurred by or for a party 
other than an insured are deemed to be 
damages because of "bodily injury" or 
"property damage", provided: 
(a) Liability to such party for, or for the cost 
of, that party's defense has also been 
assumed in the same "insured contract"; 
and 
(b) Such attorneys' fees and litigation 
expenses are for defense of that party 
against a civil or alternative dispute 
resolution proceeding in which damages 
to which this insurance applies are 
alleged. 
c. Liquor Liability 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" for which 
any insured may be held liable by reason of: 
(1) Causing or contributing to the intoxication of 
any person; 
(2) The furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a 
person under the legal drinking age or 
under the influence of alcohol; or 
(3) Any statute, ordinance or regulation relating 
to the sale, gift, distribution or use of 
alcoholic beverages. 
This exclusion applies even if the claims 
against any insured allege negligence or other 
wrongdoing in:
(a) The supervision, hiring, employment, 
training or monitoring of others by that 
insured; or
(b) Providing 
or 
failing 
to 
provide 
transportation 
with 
respect 
to 
any 
person that may be under the influence

with the beginning of the policy period shown in the 
Declarations, unless the policy period is extended 
after issuance for an additional period of less than 12

SECTION IV – COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY 
CONDITIONS 
1. Bankruptcy 
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the 
insured's estate will not relieve us of our 
obligations under this Coverage Part. 
2. Duties In The Event Of Occurrence, Offense, 
Claim Or Suit 
a. You must see to it that we are notified as soon 
as practicable of an "occurrence" or an offense 
which may result in a claim. To the extent 
possible, notice should include: 
(1) How, when and where the "occurrence" or 
offense took place; 
(2) The names and addresses of any injured 
persons and witnesses; and 
(3) The nature and location of any injury or 
damage arising out of the "occurrence" or 
offense. 
b. If a claim is made or "suit" is brought against 
any insured, you must: 
(1) Immediately record the specifics of the 
claim or "suit" and the date received; and 
(2) Notify us as soon as practicable. 
You must see to it that we receive written 
notice of the claim or "suit" as soon as 
practicable. 
c. You and any other involved insured must: 
(1) Immediately 
send 
us 
copies 
of 
any 
demands, notices, summonses or legal

information; 
(3) Cooperate with us in the investigation or 
settlement of the claim or defense against 
the "suit"; and 
(4) Assist us, upon our request, in the 
enforcement of any right against any 
person or organization which may be liable 
to the insured because of injury or damage 
to which this insurance may also apply. 
d. No insured will, except at that insured's own 
cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any 
obligation, or incur any expense, other than for 
first aid, without our consent.

b. To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of 
its terms have been fully complied with. 
A person or organization may sue us to recover on 
an agreed settlement or on a final judgment 
against an insured; but we will not be liable for 
damages that are not payable under the terms of 
this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the 
applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement 
means a settlement and release of liability signed 
by us, the insured and the claimant or the

4. Other Insurance 
If other valid and collectible insurance is available 
to the insured for a loss we cover under 
Coverages A or B of this Coverage Part, our 
obligations are limited as follows: 
a. Primary Insurance 
This insurance is primary except when 
Paragraph b. below applies. If this insurance is 
primary, our obligations are not affected unless 
any of the other insurance is also primary. 
Then, we will share with all that other 
insurance 
by 
the 
method 
described 
in 
Paragraph c. below. 
b. Excess Insurance 
(1) This insurance is excess over: 
(a) Any of the other insurance, whether 
primary, excess, contingent or on any 
other basis: 
(i) That is Fire, Extended Coverage, 
Builder's Risk, Installation Risk or 
similar coverage for "your work"; 
(ii) That is Fire insurance for premises 
rented 
to 
you 
or 
temporarily 
occupied by you with permission of 
the owner; 
(iii) That is insurance purchased by you 
to cover your liability as a tenant for 
"property 
damage" 
to 
premises 
rented 
to 
you 
or 
temporarily 
occupied by you with permission of 
the owner; or
(iv) If 
the 
loss 
arises 
out 
of 
the 
maintenance or use of aircraft, 
"autos" or watercraft to the extent not 
subject to Exclusion g. of Section I – 
Coverage A – Bodily Injury And 
Property Damage Liability. 
(b) Any other primary insurance available to 
you 
covering 
liability 
for 
damages 
arising 
out 
of 
the 
premises 
or 
operations, 
or 
the 
products 
and 
completed operations, for which you 
have been added as an additional 
insured.
(2) When this insurance is excess, we will have 
no duty under Coverages A or B to defend 
the insured against any "suit" if any other 
insurer has a duty to defend the insured 
against that "suit". If no other insurer 
defends, we will undertake to do so, but we 
will be entitled to the insured's rights 
against all those other insurers. 
(3) When this insurance is excess over other 
insurance, we will pay only our share of the 
amount of the loss, if any, that exceeds the 
sum of:
(a) The total amount that all such other 
insurance would pay for the loss in the 
absence of this insurance; and 
(b) The total of all deductible and self-
insured amounts under all that other 
insurance.
(4) We will share the remaining loss, if any, 
with any other insurance that is not 
described 
in 
this 
Excess 
Insurance 
provision and was not bought specifically to 
apply in excess of the Limits of Insurance 
shown in the Declarations of this Coverage 
Part. 
c. Method Of Sharing 
If all of the other insurance permits contribution 
by equal shares, we will follow this method 
also. Under this approach each insurer 
contributes equal amounts until it has paid its 
applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss 
remains, whichever comes first. 
If any of the other insurance does not permit 
contribution by equal shares, we will contribute 
by limits. Under this method, each insurer's 
share is based on the ratio of its applicable 
limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of 
insurance of all insurers. 
5. Premium Audit 
a. We will compute all premiums for this 
Coverage Part in accordance with our rules 
and rates. 
b. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as 
advance premium is a deposit premium only. 
At the close of each audit period we will 
compute the earned premium for that period 
and send notice to the first Named Insured. 
The due date for audit and retrospective 
premiums is the date shown as the due date 
on the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit 
premiums paid for the policy period is greater 
than the earned premium, we will return the 
excess to the first Named Insured. 
c. The first Named Insured must keep records of 
the 
information 
we 
need 
for 
premium 
computation, and send us copies at such times 
as we may request. 
6. Representations 
By accepting this policy, you agree: 
a. The statements in the Declarations are 
accurate and complete; 

CG 00 01 04 13

b. Those 
statements 
are 
based 
upon 
representations you made to us; and 
c. We have issued this policy in reliance upon 
your representations. 
7. Separation Of Insureds 
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and 
any rights or duties specifically assigned in this 
Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this 
insurance applies: 
a. As if each Named Insured were the only 
Named Insured; and 
b. Separately to each insured against whom claim 
is made or "suit" is brought. 
8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others 
To Us 
If the insured has rights to recover all or part of 
any payment we have made under this Coverage 
Part, those rights are transferred to us. The 
insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. 
At our request, the insured will bring "suit" or 
transfer those rights to us and help us enforce 
them. 
9. When We Do Not Renew 
If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we 
will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured 
shown in the Declarations written notice of the 
nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the 
expiration date. 
If notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient 
proof of notice.

LIQUOR LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM
Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. 
Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, 
duties and what is and is not covered. 
Throughout this policy the words "you" and "your" 
refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, 
and any other person or organization qualifying as a 
Named Insured under this policy. The words "we", 
"us" and "our" refer to the company providing this 
insurance. 
The word "insured" means any person or organization 
qualifying as such under Section II – Who Is An 
Insured. 
Other words and phrases that appear in quotation 
marks have special meaning. Refer to Section V – 
Definitions. 
SECTION I – LIQUOR LIABILITY COVERAGE 
1. Insuring Agreement 
a. We will pay those sums that the insured 
becomes legally obligated to pay as damages 
because of "injury" to which this insurance 
applies if liability for such "injury" is imposed on 
the insured by reason of the selling, serving or 
furnishing of any alcoholic beverage. We will 
have the right and duty to defend the insured 
against any "suit" seeking those damages. 
However, we will have no duty to defend the 
insured against any "suit" seeking damages for 
"injury" to which this insurance does not apply. 
We may, at our discretion, investigate any 
"injury" and settle any claim or "suit" that may 
result. But: 
(1) The amount we will pay for damages is 
limited as described in Section III – Limits 
Of Insurance; and 
(2) Our right and duty to defend ends when we 
have used up the applicable limit of 
insurance in the payment of judgments or 
settlements. 
No other obligation or liability to pay sums or 
perform acts or services is covered unless 
explicitly provided for under Supplementary 
Payments. 
b. This insurance applies to "injury" only if:
(1) The "injury" occurs during the policy period 
in the "coverage territory"; and
(2) Prior to the policy period, no insured listed 
under Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is 
An Insured and no "employee" authorized 
by you to give or receive notice of an 
"injury" or claim, knew that the "injury" had 
occurred, in whole or in part. If such a listed 
insured or authorized "employee" knew, 
prior to the policy period, that the "injury" 
occurred, then any continuation, change or 
resumption of such "injury" during or after 
the policy period will be deemed to have 
been known prior to the policy period.
c. "Injury" which occurs during the policy period 
and was not, prior to the policy period, known 
to have occurred by any insured listed under 
Paragraph 1. of Section II – Who Is An Insured 
or any "employee" authorized by you to give or 
receive notice of an "injury" or claim, includes 
any continuation, change or resumption of that 
"injury" after the end of the policy period.
d. "Injury" will be deemed to have been known to 
have occurred at the earliest time when any 
insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II 
– Who Is An Insured or any "employee" 
authorized by you to give or receive notice of 
an "injury" or claim:
(1) Reports all, or any part, of the "injury" to us 
or any other insurer;
(2) Receives a written or verbal demand or 
claim for damages because of the "injury"; 
or
(3) Becomes aware by any other means that 
"injury" has occurred or has begun to occur.
2. Exclusions 
This insurance does not apply to: 
a. Expected Or Intended Injury 
"Injury" 
expected 
or 
intended 
from 
the 
standpoint of the insured. This exclusion does 
not apply to "bodily injury" resulting from the 
use of reasonable force to protect persons or 
property. 
b. Workers' Compensation And Similar Laws 
Any obligation of the insured under a workers' 
compensation, 
disability 
benefits 
or 
unemployment compensation law or any 
similar law.

and in the course of: 
(a) Employment by the insured; or 
(b) Performing duties related to the conduct 
of the insured's business; or 
(2) The spouse, child, parent, brother or sister 
of that "employee" as a consequence of 
Paragraph (1) above. 
This exclusion applies whether the insured 
may be liable as an employer or in any other 
capacity and to any obligation to share 
damages with or repay someone else who 
must pay damages because of the "injury".
d. Liquor License Not In Effect 
"Injury" arising out of any alcoholic beverage 
sold, served or furnished while any required 
license is not in effect. 
e. Your Product 
"Injury" arising out of "your product". This 
exclusion does not apply to "injury" for which 
the insured or the insured's indemnitees may 
be held liable by reason of: 
(1) Causing or contributing to the intoxication of 
any person; 
(2) The furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a 
person under the legal drinking age or 
under the influence of alcohol; or 
(3) Any statute, ordinance or regulation relating 
to the sale, gift, distribution or use of 
alcoholic beverages. 
f. Other Insurance 
Any "injury" with respect to which other 
insurance is afforded, or would be afforded but 
for the exhaustion of the limits of insurance. 
This exclusion does not apply if the other 
insurance responds to liability for "injury" 
imposed on the insured by reason of the 
selling, serving or furnishing of any alcoholic 
beverage. 
g. War
"Injury", however caused, arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of:
(1) War, including undeclared or civil war;
(2) Warlike action by a military force, including 
action in hindering or defending against an 
actual 
or 
expected 
attack,

any

using military personnel or other agents; or
(3) Insurrection, rebellion, revolution, usurped 
power, or action taken by governmental 
authority in hindering or defending against 
any of these.

or settle, or any "suit" against an insured we defend: 
1. All expenses we incur. 
2. The cost of bonds to release attachments, but only

of earnings up to $250 a day because of time off

"suit". However, these payments do not include 
attorneys' fees or attorneys' expenses taxed 
against the insured.
5. Prejudgment interest awarded against the insured 
on that part of the judgment we pay. If we make an 
offer to pay the applicable limit of insurance, we 
will not pay any prejudgment interest based on 
that period of time after the offer. 
6. All interest on the full amount of any judgment that 
accrues after entry of the judgment and before we 
have paid, offered to pay, or deposited in court the 
part of the judgment that is within the applicable 
limit of insurance. 
7. Expenses incurred by the insured for first aid 
administered to others at the time of an event to 
which this insurance applies.

Page 3 of 6
d. An organization other than a partnership, joint 
venture or limited liability company, you are an

stockholders are also insureds, but only with 
respect to their liability as stockholders. 
e. A trust, you are an insured. Your trustees are 
also insureds, but only with respect to their

2. Each of the following is also an insured: 
a. Your "employees", other than either your

other than a partnership, joint venture or limited 
liability company) or your managers (if you are 
a limited liability company), but only for acts 
within the scope of their employment by you or 
while performing duties related to the conduct 
of your business. However, none of these 
"employees" is an insured for: 
(1) "Injury": 
(a) To you, to your partners or members (if 
you are a partnership or joint venture), 
to your members (if you are a limited 
liability company), or to a co-"employee" 
while that co-"employee" is either in the

maintenance or use of that property; and 
(2) Until your legal representative has been

c. Your legal representative if you die, but only 
with 
respect 
to 
duties 
as

3. Any organization you newly acquire or form, other 
than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability 
company, and over which you maintain ownership 
or majority interest, will qualify as a Named 
Insured if there is no other similar insurance 
available to that organization. However: 
a. Coverage under this provision is afforded only 
until the 90th day after you acquire or form the 
organization or the end of the policy period, 
whichever is earlier; and 
b. Coverage does not apply to "injury" that 
occurred before you acquired or formed the 
organization. 
No person or organization is an insured with respect 
to the conduct of any current or past partnership, joint 
venture or limited liability company that is not shown 
as a Named Insured in the Declarations. 
SECTION III – LIMITS OF INSURANCE 
1. The Limits of Insurance shown in the Declarations 
and the rules below fix the most we will pay 
regardless of the number of: 
a. Insureds; 
b. Claims made or "suits" brought; or 
c. Persons or organizations making claims or 
bringing "suits". 
2. The Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay for all 
"injury" as the result of the selling, serving or 
furnishing of alcoholic beverages. 
3. Subject to the Aggregate Limit, the Each Common 
Cause Limit is the most we will pay for all "injury" 
sustained 
by 
one 
or 
more 
persons 
or 
organizations as the result of the selling, serving 
or furnishing of any alcoholic beverage to any one 
person. 
The Limits of Insurance of this Coverage Part apply 
separately to each consecutive annual period and to 
any remaining period of less than 12 months, starting 
with the beginning of the policy period shown in the 
Declarations, unless the policy period is extended 
after issuance for an additional period of less than 12 
months. In that case, the additional period will be 
deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes 
of determining the Limits of Insurance. 
SECTION IV – LIQUOR LIABILITY CONDITIONS
1. Bankruptcy 
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the 
insured's estate will not relieve us of our 
obligations under this Coverage Part. 

Page 4 of 6
© Insurance Services Office, Inc., 2012 
CG 00 33 04 13
2. Duties In The Event Of Injury, Claim Or Suit 
a. You must see to it that we are notified as soon 
as practicable of an "injury" which may result in 
a claim. To the extent possible, notice should 
include: 
(1) How, when and where the "injury" took 
place; 
(2) The names and addresses of any injured 
persons and witnesses; and 
(3) The nature and location of any "injury".
b. If a claim is made or "suit" is brought against 
any insured, you must: 
(1) Immediately record the specifics of the 
claim or "suit" and the date received; and 
(2) Notify us as soon as practicable. 
You must see to it that we receive written 
notice of the claim or "suit" as soon as 
practicable. 
c. You and any other involved insured must: 
(1) Immediately 
send 
us 
copies 
of 
any 
demands, notices, summonses or legal 
papers received in connection with the 
claim or "suit"; 
(2) Authorize us to obtain records and other 
information; 
(3) Cooperate with us in the investigation or 
settlement of the claim or defense against 
the "suit"; and 
(4) Assist us, upon our request, in the 
enforcement of any right against any 
person or organization which may be liable 
to the insured because of "injury" to which 
this insurance may also apply. 
d. No insured will, except at that insured's own 
cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any 
obligation, or incur any expense, other than for 
first aid, without our consent. 
3. Legal Action Against Us 
No person or organization has a right under this 
Coverage Part: 
a. To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into 
a "suit" asking for damages from an insured; or 
b. To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of 
its terms have been fully complied with. 
A person or organization may sue us to recover on 
an agreed settlement or on a final judgment 
against an insured; but we will not be liable for 
damages that are not payable under the terms of 
this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the 
applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement 
means a settlement and release of liability signed 
by us, the insured and the claimant or the 
claimant's legal representative. 
4. Other Insurance 
If other valid and collectible insurance is available 
to the insured for a loss we cover under this 
Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as 
follows: 
a. Primary Insurance 
This insurance is primary. Our obligations are 
not affected unless any of the other insurance 
is also primary. Then, we will share with all that 
other insurance by the method described in b. 
below. 
b. Method Of Sharing 
If all of the other insurance permits contribution 
by equal shares, we will follow this method 
also. Under this approach each insurer 
contributes equal amounts until it has paid its 
applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss 
remains, whichever comes first. 
If any of the other insurance does not permit 
contribution by equal shares, we will contribute 
by limits. Under this method, each insurer's 
share is based on the ratio of its applicable 
limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of 
insurance of all insurers. 
5. Premium Audit 
a. We will compute all premiums for this 
Coverage Part in accordance with our rules 
and rates. 
b. Premium shown in this Coverage Part as 
advance premium is a deposit premium only. 
At the close of each audit period we will 
compute the earned premium for that period 
and send notice to the first Named Insured. 
The due date for audit and retrospective 
premiums is the date shown as the due date 
on the bill. If the sum of the advance and audit 
premiums paid for the policy period is greater 
than the earned premium, we will return the 
excess to the first Named Insured. 

CG 00 33 04 13

Page 5 of 6
c. The first Named Insured must keep records of 
the 
information 
we 
need 
for 
premium 
computation, and send us copies at such times 
as we may request. 
6. Representations 
By accepting this policy, you agree: 
a. The statements in the Declarations are 
accurate and complete; 
b. Those 
statements 
are 
based 
upon 
representations you made to us; and 
c. We have issued this policy in reliance upon 
your representations. 
7. Separation Of Insureds 
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and 
any rights or duties specifically assigned in this 
Coverage Part to the first Named Insured, this 
insurance applies: 
a. As if each Named Insured were the only 
Named Insured; and 
b. Separately to each insured against whom claim 
is made or "suit" is brought. 
8. Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others 
To Us 
If the insured has rights to recover all or part of 
any payment we have made under this Coverage 
Part, those rights are transferred to us. The 
insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. 
At our request, the insured will bring "suit" or 
transfer those rights to us and help us enforce 
them. 
9. When We Do Not Renew 
If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we 
will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured 
shown in the Declarations written notice of the 
nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the 
expiration date. 
If notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient 
proof of notice.

4. Any public entity as an additional insured, and the officers, officials, employees, agents and/or volunteers 
of that public entity, as applicable, who may be named in the Schedule above, when you have agreed in a

“personal and advertising injury” caused, in whole or in part, by:
a.
Your negligent acts or omissions; or
b.
The negligent acts or omissions of those acting on your behalf;

No such public entity or individual is an additional insured for liability arising out of the sole negligence by

Other Insurance

Primary Insurance

NIA-061 GL 02 19
Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc. with its

Page 2 of 2
This insurance is primary if you have agreed in a written contract or written agreement:
(1) That this insurance be primary.  If other insurance is also primary, we will share with all that 
other insurance as described in c. below; or
(2) The coverage afforded by this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional 
insured(s)’ own insurance.
Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to other insurance to which the additional insured(s) has been 
added as an additional insured or to other insurance described in paragraph b. below.
b.
Excess Insurance
This insurance is excess over:
1.
 Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:
(a) That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder’s Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for 
“your work”;
(b) That is fire, lightning, or explosion insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily 
occupied by you with permission of the owner;
(c) That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for “property damage” 
to premises temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or
(d) If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, “autos” or watercraft to the extent 
not subject to Exclusion g. of SECTION I – COVERAGE A – BODILY INJURY AND 
PROPERTY DAMAGE.
(e) Any other insurance available to an additional insured(s) under this Endorsement covering 
liability for damages which are subject to this endorsement and for which the additional 
insured(s) has been added as an additional insured by that other insurance.
(1) When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the 
additional insured(s) against any “suit” if any other insurer has a duty to defend the additional 
insured(s) against that “suit”.  If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we 
will be entitled to the additional insured(s)’ rights against all those other insurers.
(2) When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount 
of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:
(a) The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this 
insurance; and
(b) The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.
(3) We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this 
Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits 
of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.
c.
Methods of Sharing
If all of the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) permits contribution by equal 
shares, we will follow this method also.  Under this approach each insurer contributes equal 
amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever 
comes first.
If any other the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) does not permit contribution 
by equal shares, we will contribute by limits.  Under this method, each insurer’s share is based on 
the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

No such public entity or individual is an additional insured for liability arising out of the sole negligence by

respect to liability arising out of or related to your activities as a real estate manager for that person or 
organization.
B.
SECTION III – LIMITS OF INSURANCE is amended to include:
8. The limits of insurance applicable to the public entity and applicable individuals identified as an additional

not in addition to the limits of insurance under this policy.
C.
With respect to the insurance provided to the additional insured(s), Condition 4. Other Insurance of 
SECTION IV – COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS is replaced by the following:
4.
Other Insurance
a.
Primary Insurance
This insurance is primary if you have agreed in a written contract or written agreement:
(1) That this insurance be primary.  If other insurance is also primary, we will share with all that 
other insurance as described in c. below; or

(2) The coverage afforded by this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional 
insured(s)’ own insurance.
Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply to other insurance to which the additional insured(s) has been 
added as an additional insured or to other insurance described in paragraph b. below.
b.
Excess Insurance
This insurance is excess over:
1.
 Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:
(a) That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder’s Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for 
“your work”;
(b) That is fire, lightning, or explosion insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily 
occupied by you with permission of the owner;
(c) That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for “property damage” 
to premises temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or
(d) If the loss arises out of the maintenance or use of aircraft, “autos” or watercraft to the extent 
not subject to Exclusion g. of SECTION I – COVERAGE A – BODILY INJURY AND 
PROPERTY DAMAGE.
(e) Any other insurance available to an additional insured(s) under this Endorsement covering 
liability for damages which are subject to this endorsement and for which the additional 
insured(s) has been added as an additional insured by that other insurance.
(1) When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the 
additional insured(s) against any “suit” if any other insurer has a duty to defend the additional 
insured(s) against that “suit”.  If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we 
will be entitled to the additional insured(s)’ rights against all those other insurers.
(2) When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount 
of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:
(a) The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this 
insurance; and
(b) The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.
(3) We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this 
Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits 
of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.
c.
Methods of Sharing
If all of the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) permits contribution by equal 
shares, we will follow this method also.  Under this approach each insurer contributes equal 
amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever 
comes first.
If any other the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) does not permit contribution 
by equal shares, we will contribute by limits.  Under this method, each insurer’s share is based on 
the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

B.
With respect to the insurance afforded to these additional insured(s), the following additional exclusions 
apply.
This insurance does not apply to “bodily injury” or “property damage” occurring after:
1.
All work, including materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work, on the project 
(other than service, maintenance or repairs) to be performed by or on behalf of the additional insured(s)

other insurance as described in c. below; or
(2) The coverage afforded by this insurance is primary and non-contributory with the additional

NIA-061 LL 03 25

Page 2 of 2
b.
Excess Insurance
This insurance is excess over:
1.
 Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:
(a) That is Fire, Extended Coverage, Builder’s Risk, Installation Risk or similar coverage for 
“your work”;
(b) That is fire, lightning, or explosion insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily 
occupied by you with permission of the owner;
(c) That is insurance purchased by you to cover your liability as a tenant for “property damage” 
to premises temporarily occupied by you with permission of the owner; or
(d) That is any other insurance available to an additional insured(s) under this Endorsement 
covering liability for damages which are subject to this endorsement and for which the 
additional insured(s) has been added as an additional insured by that other insurance.
(1) When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty to defend the additional insured(s) against 
any “suit” if any other insurer has a duty to defend the additional insured(s) against that “suit”.  
If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the additional 
insured(s)’ rights against all those other insurers.
(2) When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount 
of the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of:
(a) The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this 
insurance; and
(b) The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.
(3) We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this 
Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits 
of Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.
c.
Methods of Sharing
If all of the other insurance available to the additional insured(s) permits contribution by equal 
shares, we will follow this method also.  Under this approach each insurer contributes equal 
amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever 
comes first.
If any other insurance available to the additional insured(s) does not permit contribution by equal 
shares, we will contribute by limits.  Under this method, each insurer’s share is based on the ratio 
of its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.
